Tyler?
Lebih buruk lagi.
Hey! hati hati dong!
- Hey!
semenjak Hannah Baker bunuh diri.
Kami tidak pernah mengira bahwa persidangan ini akan terjadi.
kami pikir ini akan cepat berlalu.
itu membuatku sadar bahwa ini semua tidak seperti itu.
Segalanya sudah berbeda sekarang.
kamu sudah janji.
Aku sudah janji banyak hal padamu.

"Cody Jantzen" dari Texas.

put that part of my life to rest.
-Yeah. Totally.
But I meant, are you ready for the needle?
Breathe deep. Stay calm.
I'm good, I'm fine.
It's his first time.
Really?
it's for a friend of yours?
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Half done.
Wow.
Sweet. All right, cool.
Yeah, keep going.
everyone's still hurting.
Some more than others.
Oh, shit.
It's a fucking comma.
So it signifies a pause.
in order to faint.
I fucking fail.
Hey.
Hannah will forgive you.
I'm not thinking about her.
-I'm not.
I haven't for months now.
Okay.
her folks are gonna settle,
and you know, fuck it all.
Fuck the world.
All I care about is you.
we're over it.
Maybe it works for a while.
Sure you're ready for this?
Are you sure you are? I've done it before.
Yeah, I'm ready, I mean...
I have been, and I am today. Ready.
-Yeah.
-Yes.
-It's nothing.
-Wait, those are cuts.
-I used to, a long time ago.
But those are recent.
if you even just think about it.
Have you been trying meditation?
boring thing in the world.
a mindfulness walk.
I'm fucking serious, Skye.
I will text you every hour.
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.
I promise I'll call.
Okay.
I tried not thinking about it.
and live my life.
Some days I wasn't.
and got news I wasn't expecting.
- She's good.
You should invite her in.
what, the seventh grade?
-We'll have her over for dinner.
-She doesn't eat?
just not in situations with parents.
about the trial.
What? What trial?
Hannah's trial. It's moving forward.
What?
-We thought it was.
the district's final offer today.
It starts tomorrow.
Tomorrow? How is that possible?
They were up against the trial date.
the Bakers rejected the settlement.
So, I'll get to testify about Bryce?
that you're not on either witness list.
Why not?
based on a variety of factors.
Bryce raped Hannah.
You heard his confession.
before you dropped out.
I didn't drop out of the case.
created a conflict of interest.
so can someone do something?
If we knew the girl on tape nine.
Mom, it's not my place to tell you that.
-This is a fucking joke. He confessed!
Clay, I'm worried about your anger.
That's what you're worried about?
I'm not angry, Mom. I'm fine.
That's why you're never home?
We had a deal.
my grades, I get to have a life of my own.
You put a lock on your door.
Which you found out by trying to open it?
very hard for you.
It's not.
So I'll just keep on like that.
This trial going forward,
it affects the whole town.
We have to think about it all over again,
how Hannah lived and how she died.
And how it changed all our lives.
-Hey, Dad.
about you going back to school tomorrow.
Well, I have to go back with Jessica.
and she's going back tomorrow.
more like a week, maybe two?
Dad, it has to be now.
- Yeah.
talking about me for months now.
-It's a small town, Dad.
without people looking at me.
Or talking about what I did.
And I'm sick of hiding from them all.
You're recuperating.
I can still do that. Just out there.
people are finally gonna hear her story,
and I want to help tell it.
Okay. Well, you keep pushing ahead.
you're feeling stronger.
Good work today, by the way.
You think I'll get to testify?
to your doctors and the court.
Okay? Get some sleep.
I love you.
Hey, what'd they say?
-They don't like it, but they said yes.
This trial has me freaked out.
What do they know?
We're gonna find out.
Jess...
we're gonna stick to the plan.
I don't remember what happened to me,
what happened to you.
-Right.
You feel okay about seeing Bryce again?
Yeah. Totally.
You hurt.
Worse, you feel... powerless.
to talk about what happened...
it's never going to change.
to understand how it all happened.
The whole story, you know?
are as bad as they've ever been.
Mom, it's gonna be fine.
to testify. I want to be the first.
Yeah. I told the lawyers that. I know.
Yeah, I know.
I'll be home soon. Okay? Bye.
And I don't want to be afraid anymore.
I don't want to be afraid.
is going forward.
I don't why you need to be the first.
-That's why I have to be first.
about how things are at school,
and somebody has to do that.
to want to do this for Hannah.
It's not just for Hannah, okay?
It's for me, and Alex, and...
and I have to.
extra units outside the courthouse.
I can get coverage if I have to.
Mom, did I leave a note?
Yes. You left a note.
I want to see it.
I don't know that you're ready to--
Or know why I did it?
to think about it
or you just don't want to talk about it?
I want to see it!
-Of course we didn't throw it away.
the next time you see Dr. Ellman?
I'll talk to him about it. Please.
Do you want to talk about it?
Um...
What does this mean?
What does that mean?
How could I have stopped it?
that you felt terrible guilt.
is too much for any one person to take on.
You know that now, right?
"I could have stopped it."
Good morning.
Are you ready for battle?
for something like this?
You are. We are.
Truly, it's above and beyond.
This is what I do.
who truly knows what you're going through.
Remember that. I will be your strength.
I'm not afraid. I'm not.
I've dreaded this day, but now I'm just...
-Mm-hm.
-Good.
Hold on to that.
were you able to convince him to--?
No.
to come to court today.
But I knew I had to be here.
For Hannah.
For her mom.
For everyone who gets bullied
get away with it.
Montgomery De La Cruz, Bryce Walker.
- Don't worry about it.
-Clay.
Don't know, don't care.
Yeah, all that Hannah Baker shit
will get dredged up all over again.
My dad's got the trial covered.
We'll figure it out.
is coming back to Liberty?
-Again, man. Don't know, don't care.
Don't worry about the fucking trial, man.
Hannah's voice.
-But, Dennis, I want them to hear
-Olivia,
just to get the tapes admitted.
-Yes, and if one goes in, they all go in.
without getting Hannah drunk.
leaving the scene of a crime.
-Again, we start with the school first.
and his father's legal team into it.
He raped her. The school knew about it.
it's his word against hers.
that the school was aware of.
We're starting with Tyler Down...?
of bullying at Liberty.
to get subpoenas out.
I know. I'm sorry, Dennis.
back on the table, I couldn't stay silent.
Hannah's story needs to be told.
And we're gonna tell it.
you're gonna hear testimony
at Liberty High,
from Hannah's own parents.
a poisonous school culture,
and an administration
but didn't.
innocent, sensitive girl
who was bullied to death.
about a precious girl that we've lost,
there are stories of the living.
Justice must be done.
and for those who are still suffering.
to every story.
what they believe to be Hannah's story,
but nothing is as simple as it seems.
No one is just a victim.
but there's plenty of blame to go around.
And you'll make up your own mind.
- Okay. Bye-bye.
Hey.
-So do you.
-It's a good look on you.
-They're checking you out.
You're pretty and sad. People love that.
All my scars are inside.
for joking about this.
I plan to look like I'm enjoying it.
They're looking at you more.
They're looking at you more.
Which one of us is more tragic?
of his stupid polls.
-I can carry my own books.
so let me help, don't be a dick.
- Thank you.
I meant to ask you guys about my note.
-My suicide note.
-It's not radioactive.
we're not allowed to talk about suicide.
Or you. Or Hannah.
-Says the school.
They made a rule the day after you...
after that day.
you get suspended.
-Yeah.
- They find you in the hallway...
first period? Mr. Wood?
Yeah. I can't turn that fast.
-Nothing.
Hey! Jess, Alex, welcome back, you guys.
-Seriously? "Welcome back"?
Alex, stop. I'll see you guys after third.
It's gonna be a good day.
I told you not to do that, man.
They act like they own the school.
Hey, man. You okay?
They get in your head...
I'm fine.
and other people believe them.
And it gets to the point where...
the lies might as well be the truth.
about Hannah Baker?
Yes, they did. All the time.
And another girl I know,
she had something happen to her.
She had to leave school for a while.
the story got totally twisted.
of raping her.
and Jessica stopped coming to school,
Bryce just spun the whole story.
and that she, like, wanted it.
Then why would Justin say all that shit?
for cheating on Justin with him.
Such a fucking asshole.
maybe it's best that we...
just don't poke the bear, you know?
-I don't think there is a normal anymore.
Be seated, please. Two minutes.
you said you took pictures of Hannah.
Yes, I did.
and I felt terrible about it.
enjoyed having you take her picture?
-Defense exhibit B.
Tyler...
did you take these pictures?
Um...
yes.
Yeah, I did. I did.
Hannah was allegedly bullied?
I guess, before.
-I, um...
It was the first day of school.
Sophomore year.
I was the Student Life photographer.
everyone still in their summer tan.
Hey, guys. Hey, uh, yearbook?
-Cool.
Football team. Looking good, guys.
What? They were special memories.
-It's bad enough we gotta--
Oh.
-Yeah, Hannah Baker.
She's fucking hot.
-Gross. Tyler, go away.
It's for yearbook.
Hey. Shoot me.
-Shoot me and the locker that won't open.
Yeah. Yeah, all right. Um...
Uh, here, I can actually help with this.
I'm Hannah.
which I think was at your house.
-Sorry, this is just-- Cool.
-Yeah. No worries.
-Oh, um, Tyler. Tyler, yeah.
do a photo shoot or something?
Sure.
I told her to come camera-ready.
Whoa. Isn't that a little much?
-It's for a photo shoot.
Just take it down a notch. Okay?
Don't want people getting the wrong idea.
I wasn't sure why.
She didn't need the makeup anyway.
She was so beautiful.
And she was so nice to me.
I'm sorry, I'm not camera-ready.
Sure you are. It's good. You're good.
Thanks.
as who you are, okay?
Yeah. Okay. Cool.
Yeah.
So, should we...?
I wondered who made her cry.
when she only ever deserved to be happy?
Yes. Okay, keep that up.
Wow, you're... you're really amazing.
-Uh...
-Of course.
Perfect.
the picture's only part of the story.
liked having her picture taken.
Well, I mean, that day--
What else are you not telling us?
- Withdrawn.
resulted from any of the photos you took?
No, it's not true.
I spread around a picture of Hannah.
And then Clay Jensen did the same to me.
if Hannah liked the attention?
I mean, she... she liked it then.
sent that picture around...
it told a story that wasn't true.
-Hey, can I talk to you?
I'd been there too.
I saw her for who she really was.
Hey, Hannah.
What? What do you want?
Um...
that there's this picture going around--
Yeah, there is. Thank you.
Look, I just wanted to say to you, um...
you're the most beautiful girl at Liberty.
If you want to do another photo shoot--
Get away from me.
I knew I had said the wrong thing.
I always say the wrong thing.
from the shoot,
so she could see how beautiful she was.
as a slut or whatever.
as like, a gift.
But she was with... a boy.
And then I got shy, and I hid from them.
Have a good night.
just so I could get a better look.
And...
...I started to take pictures.
of what I was seeing.
What did you see?
than chatting that night, wasn't she?
-She wasn't just texting, okay?
She was sexting.
And, like, showing herself off...
to some guy.
I just...
didn't understand why she would do that,
that special part of herself
with just... some guy.
who didn't know how special she was.
opened herself up for a reaction,
for what followed?
Isn't she actually responsible?
What about you, Tyler?
for the things that happen to you?
Hey, Clay.
-Were you at court this morning?
I couldn't take Tyler's lies, so I left.
Is everything gonna come out?
How the fuck would I know?
Well, when do you testify?
I don't.
Why would they call me and not call you?
I don't know and I don't care.
How can you not care?
about my grades, and that's plenty.
they can ask you anything, right?
You stole a fucking note.
What are you worried about?
What about the tape you made?
with Bryce? What does he have on you?
I just-- I have to play baseball with him.
wouldn't fuck up everybody's life.
Well, too late.
I mean, it's not like it goes both ways.
and the people who do the hurting.
Mr. Walker.
if I might have a word with you.
Mr. Porter.
Your hair looks good. Get to class.
What's up?
Jessica Davis is back today.
Wanna let you know I got my eye on you.
You and a dozen college scouts.
what that's got to do with Jessica.
Listen, you little shit.
that I need to know about you.
you look in her direction,
and I will fuck up your life.
you can speak to me that way.
I didn't.
I was just checking in on you.
with the trial starting and everything.
-Do I?
We'll find out.
The day so far, not great?
Why didn't you tell me they outlawed me?
-I mean, talking about me.
Or talking about me trying to kill myself.
-Yeah.
to morning announcements.
And teachers. And people.
You had a question for me?
that I left a suicide note?
Um...
-Why didn't you tell me about it?
Well, I-I didn't...
was the kind of thing that you talk about
recovering from it.
Look. What do you think that this meant?
You have it here?
for talking about me.
"I could have stopped it."
"I could have stopped it"? Stopped what?
I...
I don't know. I mean...
you could've stopped Hannah.
You felt guilty. We all did.
I don't think that's it.
There's something more.
Hannah got.
Or I got.
when I leave court today
where no one looks out for us.
-I never laid a hand on you.
I told them to back off.
So why are you talking about me in court?
Did Clay tell you?
Never mind, just tell me why you talked.
didn't scare me.
What "darkroom threat"?
I don't care. You'll pay.
Mr. Walker?
if Bryce hassles you again,
you come and tell me.
in my new special skills class.
-It's not optional.
You can start tomorrow.
I mean, Hannah took sexy pictures,
of anything.
One picture never tells the whole story.
Clay.
Hey, Tony.
You told me this case was gonna settle.
- Well, they called me to testify.
I-I wouldn't worry about it.
The Bakers know you did what Hannah asked.
The school did. Why?
I don't know.
My mom said each side calls
tell their version of the story.
How am I a part of the school's story?
You didn't do anything wrong.
You don't know everything I did, Clay.
Hey, Tony.
What, um...
What do you know about Scott Reed?
Uh, the baseball player?
and he's friends with Bryce.
That's what I know. Why?
Uh, probably nothing.
Okay.
in an "affirmative consent" state.
an actual affirmative
in order to engage in intercourse.
does not demonstrate consent.
or in actions.
Does a scream count?
You want to be a comedian, Mr. Reed?
Or you wanna play ball this year?
that you take the season off.
I didn't think so.
Right.
So, affirmative consent.
Hey.
What?
It's good to see you, too.
Oh, I'm sorry. "Hi, Ryan. How are things?
Really? He is a bitch.
You should dump him. You deserve better."
That about cover it?
at Hannah's trial.
Okay.
supposed to talk about it.
Here.
Everything she wrote about that day.
All of it.
I'm not gonna say anything...
that could hurt you. I promise.
Thank you.
just like people do.
...four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six...
-Hi! How are you?
-I am good. Thank you.
-Oh, God, I missed you.
-Hey, Chle.
Jess, it's so good to have you back.
our routining for summer competitions.
-Wait. Wait, what?
-You have the athleticism and focus.
but you're ready, right?
Totally. I'm totally ready.
Well, let's start marking it out.
so maybe watch first time around.
Okay, cool.
Let's try that slider again.
Let's talk it through.
One, two, three, four...
- Yeah, of course. Why?
I already did wind sprints today.
Yeah, the breaking shit isn't breaking.
five, six, seven, eight.
-Hey, it's all right. You got this.
he can hit?
I'm just picking grass out here.
about Mexicans picking shit.
The infields are trying to be funny,
-Oh, you love us, Dempsey.
Last batter, Walker.
Then you gotta ice that arm.
up, five, six, seven...
your dad's not gonna come up?
-Okay.
Anyway, he likes you.
those first few weeks I visited you.
-Okay, so...
Cool Ranch Doritos.
-Yes. Fucking amazing.
So this is really, like, illegal?
Yeah, my mom has me on all like,
organic whole-grain macrobiotic shit.
So good. You want?
wash my hands first.
That's where it went.
The bullet. That's where it went.
that kind of gun before,
and I flinched.
in and out of my skull and into the wall.
That's what they told me.
You don't remember?
of like, a month before that.
So, the tapes?
I know about them.
And I know we all did shit, but...
I don't remember listening to them.
I took pictures of you...
while you were in your coma.
Why?
Because I knew you were gonna get better.
how far you had to go.
I'm sorry, I...
I-I don't care.
Could I see them?
Sometime?
Uh...
Yeah.
Concession stand is almost done.
on the outfield fence.
we're gonna re-line the fields,
before Thursday.
All right.
How about the naming?
of the scoreboard,
both dugouts and the concession stand.
-And we don't think this trial...
will be a distraction, do we?
We have everything very well contained.
-Good. Good.
How's the team?
of Jeff Atkins,
in years. Since your time, even.
Hey, Dad.
How's the arm?
One hundred percent.
Okay.
See you later. Bye.
- Right there.
That dude got demolished.
-Ow.
Hey, Jess. Jessica.
-Hey.
-Thank you.
So, how you doing? Okay?
-Good. Good.
We missed you. The squad did, for sure.
-Cool.
Catch up.
-Yeah.
Whatever. I'm late for dinner.
Okay.
-Hi.
Thanks for having me over.
I'm happy to have the company.
in the evenings,
and Rotarians, and...
-No, never.
Today was a good day, Olivia.
Tyler was believable,
more than anything else.
What are you working on?
Oh, um...
-Oh.
that came up today.
were so beautiful.
Ooh, that's a good one.
That's not your best angle.
That's good.
No, too much chin.
I'm deleting all of them.
in my life.
Why?
used against you, and haunt you forever.
My dear Hannah. Such drama.
Why didn't I just tell her she was pretty?
Why didn't I just say she was perfect?
Oh, Olivia. You did.
I know you did, thousands of times.
I don't know if I did.
Or I didn't enough, or...
or not in the right way.
Every morning, I would tell Tessa
in the world.
where kids called her "ugly,"
called her "worthless,"
called her "slut."
And she believed them, and not me.
This is what it's gonna be like, isn't it?
of some girl I don't even recognize.
Yes.
But you're going to have to stay strong.
You know who Hannah was.
What if I don't?
I didn't know who took these pictures.
What else don't I know?
You know how special she was.
let her be taken away from you.
You have these pictures of Hannah.
but you don't know.
doesn't mean you have the truth.
Why'd you lie about Hannah?
I didn't lie.
after what happened?
I don't know, but it was the truth.
Then who was it with?
-What's that mean?
-What about the darkroom?
-Yeah, well, it wasn't me.
Then I bet they'll come after you, too.
Who was she texting with?
I don't know.
Fuck this.
but she wasn't.
I bet I'm not the only one who knows that.
I like the color.
their spray paint again,
so I had to jack it from the True Value.
spray paint but not their ammunition.
Hey, can we, uh...?
Can we try this thing again?
Yeah. Let's do this thing.
Jesus!
Clay!
Sorry, I don't know what happened.
Okay.
What...?
Oh, my God, you're shaking. What's wrong?
Nothing, I'm... I'm fine.
Okay. Clay.
You're gonna be great.
I mean, I don't know. I mean, that's not--
Okay, shut up and get naked.
What the fuck?
What is wrong with you tonight, Clay?
I can't.
-No, I--
Look, I do. God, I do.
to be with me.
No, I do, I just...
I can't tonight.
Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow, then.
you don't know what really happened.
for a medical exception.
might not have to testify.
-Honey...
your mother and I don't like this.
They can ask anything up there.
But I have to do it.
For Hannah.
Okay, let's talk about it in the morning.
Get some sleep.
doesn't mean you have the whole story.
What are you gonna do about that?
So you talk now?
Apparently.
Oh.
