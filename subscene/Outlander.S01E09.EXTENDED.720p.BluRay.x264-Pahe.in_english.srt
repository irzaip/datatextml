1
00:00:02,018 --> 00:00:03,368
Claire:<i>Previously...</i>

2
17:02:50,397 --> 00:00:04,149
Colum doesna travel,

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:05,879
So visiting the
tenants and tacksmen

4
00:00:06,079 --> 00:00:08,209
That can't come
to the gathering,

5
17:02:54,204 --> 00:00:07,752
That falls to me.

6
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:10,652
Have you seen any of
your scottish companions

7
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:12,762
Raise funds
for the rebellion?

8
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:14,988
Let's get on with it.
Randall:Why would
dougal mackenzie

9
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,365
Rather adopt you
as one of his own

10
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:17,607
Than allow me
to question you?

11
00:00:17,172 --> 00:00:18,872
<i>I was wondering</i>
<i>if you had a potion</i>

12
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:21,751
That might open
a lad's heart
to a lassie.

13
00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:27,623
What's his name?

14
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:28,254
Horrocks.

15
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:32,140
There's a chance
to get the price
lifted from my head.

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,290
A redcoat deserter.
Claims he was there,

17
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:36,479
Saw who actually
killed the sergeant.

18
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:40,199
Claire:<i>I knew where</i>
<i>we were going</i>
<i>without having to ask,</i>

19
17:03:26,270 --> 00:00:43,089
<i>The province of a man</i>
<i>I unfortunately</i>
<i>knew all too well.</i>

20
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:46,099
I'll thank ye to take
your hands off my wife.

21
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:07,015
Dougal:
Where's your mind, lad?

22
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:08,495
Horrocks is waiting.

23
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:26,525
Already washed the dust from your throat
Mr. Horrocks?

24
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:31,821
It would be wise if you told us what happened
that night in Fort William.

25
00:01:37,387 --> 00:01:41,657
Did you or did you not tell Hugh Monroe,
you saw who shot the Sergeant?

26
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:44,401
I did.

27
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:48,116
Forgive me, but I...

28
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:51,479
I haven't tasted
fine whiskey like that in quite some time.

29
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,289
I  can use another wee nip.

30
00:01:58,683 --> 00:01:59,773
I look forward,
I'm anxious,

31
00:01:59,798 --> 00:02:03,409
That you name the person who committed the crime
I was falsely accused of.

32
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,280
Have you the gold Hugh
Monroe promised to pay?

33
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:07,221
Yes.

34
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:09,399
Then hand it over

35
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:11,195
and we'll move on with the deal.

36
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:12,435
The name, first.

37
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:16,507
You'll have it when I have the gold in my hand.

38
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:18,627
Well that was the understanding

39
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:22,185
Give him the gold.

40
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:24,979
I trust his word.

41
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:27,525
The british army
trusted him, too.

42
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:35,707
Perhaps today's not
such a good day
for business after all.

43
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:39,909
Whether you deserted
is no concern of ours,
mr. Horrocks.

44
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:41,642
We commend ye for it.

45
00:02:42,857 --> 00:02:44,227
I've come a long way,

46
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:48,106
At considerable
danger to myself,

47
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:50,998
Eluding redcoat patrols...
(speaking other language)

48
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:03,775
The man who shot the sergeant

49
00:03:04,412 --> 00:03:06,742
Was captain Jonathan Randall
himself.

50
00:03:08,331 --> 00:03:10,751
Ye expect us to believe
that a captain,

51
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:12,245
Even one as vile
as black jack,

52
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,819
Would shoot his own man?

53
00:03:14,463 --> 00:03:15,563
You know randall.

54
00:03:16,182 --> 00:03:17,972
I suppose he can answer that.

55
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:18,757
I canna use randall's
name to clear my own.

56
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:23,315
You bargained for a name.
A name is what you received.

57
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:26,913
Good day, lads.

58
00:03:30,404 --> 00:03:31,144
Let him go.

59
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:32,657
Man:Jamie!

60
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:33,801
Jamie!

61
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:38,698
Claire.

62
00:03:40,714 --> 00:03:42,434
I was minding her,
I swear.

63
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:44,533
I went for a piss and...
Where is she?

64
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,959
She must've wandered off,
and when I caught up,

65
00:03:46,955 --> 00:03:48,285
The redcoats had her.

66
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:50,076
She was fighting
and thrashing about,

67
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,558
But they took her.
They were headed south.

68
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:54,381
Hold on, Fort William?

69
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,956
I know what's on your mind boy,
but what you're thinking is impossible.

70
00:03:57,981 --> 00:03:59,383
I'm going with or without you!

71
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:00,501
Then Dougal and I must abstain from

72
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:02,908
any open action
against the British garrison.

73
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:06,273
If we were captured,  then the  consequences
upon the clan and Colum ...

74
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:08,948
No...
the risks are too great, I'm afraid.

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,640
Any man wants to ride with you
I'll not stop 'em.

76
00:04:19,188 --> 00:04:21,438
I'm not beseachin'
anyone for help.

77
00:04:21,938 --> 00:04:24,058
But I'm also not
proud to refuse.

78
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:25,241
I'll go with you.

79
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:27,128
I'm not doing
nothing special today...

80
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:29,660
- but a wee ride might be
amusing.

81
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,910
Sure, but our conditions
you will have to heed.

82
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,230

83

Where is the englishwoman?

96
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:49,552
I don't know who you mean.

97
00:06:50,094 --> 00:06:53,154
My friend here isna a bit
pleased with yer answer.

98
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,190
Pray, I don't know.

99
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:56,889
Pray that you do.

100
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:59,737
Or your next words'll be
in a lassie's voice.

101
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:04,382
The commander's office.

102
00:07:04,775 --> 00:07:05,635
In the tower.

103
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:09,535
Thank you.

104
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:15,991
(bird calling signal)

105
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:47,805
Murtagh, don't ye
wait too long.

106
00:08:46,563 --> 00:08:47,433
Claire:Help!

107
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,937
I'll thank ye to take
your hands off my wife.

108
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,029
Good god.

109
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,014
(laughs)

110
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,701
Dougal mackenzie
neglected to mention

111
00:10:07,141 --> 00:10:09,751
That you married
the stripe-backed thief.

112
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:12,374
How's my handiwork
looking these days?

113
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,103
Very well,

114
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,791
Despite your efforts.

115
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,387
I don't suppose
you'd show me?

116
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,708
Be the last thing
you ever saw.

117
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:29,275
Oh.

118
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,406
Only risk brings
the possibility
of reward, hmm?

119
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,836
Just shoot this
bastard, jamie.

120
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,210
(screams)

121
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,985
Do. Shoot me.
Shoot us both.

122
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:43,568
And alarm the entire fort
of your presence.

123
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:46,526
Oh.

124
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:50,518
It appears we're to have
an audience, madam.

125
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,358
I think we should endeavor
to enjoy ourselves.

126
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,482
I certainly shall.

127
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,394
Now, put that pistol
on the table

128
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:04,989
And let us commence
with the evening's
entertainment.

129
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,650
Do it.

130
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:09,922
Slowly.

131
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:16,183
I will slit her throat,
I swear to god.

132
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:20,900
Slowly.

133
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,568
That wasn't too hard.

134
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:32,458
Back you go.

135
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:35,644
Do it!

136
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,873
Get out of here, jamie.

137
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:43,235
Just go. Go!

138
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:45,585
Everyone, keep calm.

139
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,373
(whimpers)

140
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,203
Easy does it.

141
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:56,929
(laughs)

142
00:11:57,318 --> 00:11:59,388
Oh, first she orders
you to fire,

143
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,739
Now she orders
you to flee.

144
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,934
Who is the man
in this marriage, fraser?

145
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:04,503
I will cut off
your balls, I swear.

146
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,159
You are
a foul-mouthed scold.

147
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:09,795
For the life of me,

148
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:13,103
I cannot understand
why any man
would pledge himself

149
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:17,743
To a woman.

150
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,295
Especially such
a mendacious slut
as this one.

151
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,299
Would you like
your husband
to join us maybe?

152
00:12:32,518 --> 00:12:34,358
What do you say,
fraser, hmm?

153
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:35,662
Huh?

154
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:39,230
Or would you
prefer to watch?

155
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,219
You bluffed your way
in here with
an empty pistol.

156
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,376
Ned said not to kill anyone,

157
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:03,879
So I had all the
weapons unloaded.

158
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:04,614
This way.

159
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,120
Wait.

160
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,220
Up here.

161
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,849
You are sure
there's water down there,
aren't you?

162
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,880
Aye. I think so.

163
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,700
Still a couple hours' ride
from the drover

164
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,230
We should
water the horses.

165
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,830
Give him a drink of water,
please?

166
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:56,355
Aye.

167
00:16:13,137 --> 00:16:14,287
Are you all right?

168
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,640
Randall,
he didn't hurt you?

169
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,620
No, He didn't have time,
thanks to you.

170
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,943
I'm waiting for you
to say something.

171
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:33,413
Anything that approaches
an apology.

172
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:36,200
An apology?

173
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:41,892
I was taken hostage
by jack randall.

174
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:45,700
Are you trying to say
that's somehow my fault?

175
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,340
Well, it is your fault.

176
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,499
Had you stayed put where I ordered you to stay,
None of this would have happened.

177
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,699
Yeah, but no.
Ye won't listen to me,

178
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,499
Why mind me,
I am not but yer husband.

179
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,699
Ye take it into yer mind
to do as ye damn please

180
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,499
I find ye flat on yer back
with yer skirts up,

181
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,189
And the worst scum
of the land
between your legs,

182
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,009
About to take you
before my very eyes.

183
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,000
I begged you
to take me with you.

184
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,361
And I told you
there was no danger
in me going along.

185
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:11,600
Would you
listen to me? No.
No, I'm just a woman.

186
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,799
No, why should you
pay any attention
to what I have to say?

187
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,360
Women are only fit
to do as they're told
and obey orders.

188
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:22,750
If ye'd done that,
we wouldn't be on
the run now With a hundred redcoats
on our tail.

189
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,949
Try that again
and I'll slap you
until yer ears ring.

190
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,610
You're a brute and a fool!

191
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,199
Do you think I went and got
Captured by the english on purpose?

192
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,096
Aye! I do think
ye did it on purpose

193
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:36,161
To get back at me
for what happened
at the glade.

194
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,560
At the glade?

195
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,840
With the British deserters?

196
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,340
You think, to punish you,
I went for a walk
in the woods

197
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,590
On the chance that some
British soldiers would be going by?

198
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,530
Christ, jamie, I went for a walk!
I ordered you to stay put!

199
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,750
I don't have to do
what you tell me to.

200
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,930
Aye, you do.
You are my wife.

201
00:17:59,782 --> 00:18:01,392
Oh, your wife?
Your wife.

202
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,599
You think
I'm your property,
don't you?

203
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,875
You think I belong to you
and you can't stand

204
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,310
For someone to have
something else
that belongs to you.

205
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,411
You do belong to me
and you are my wife,

206
00:18:12,436 --> 00:18:14,046
Whether you
like it or not.

207
00:18:14,071 --> 00:18:17,041
Well, I don't like it!
I don't like it one bit!

208
00:18:18,693 --> 00:18:20,950
That doesn't matter
to you either, does it?

209
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,449
And as long as
I'm there to
warm your bed,

210
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,910
You don't care
what I think
or how I feel!

211
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,820
That's all a wife is to you.

212
00:18:28,197 --> 00:18:31,957
Something to stick
your cock into
whenever you feel the urge.

213
00:18:32,356 --> 00:18:34,486
Let go of me,
you fucking bastard!

214
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:39,505
You foul-mouthed bitch!
You'll not speak
to me that way!

215
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,330
I went to you
at fort william

216
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,470
Armed with an empty pistol
and my bare hands.

217
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,480
When you screamed...

218
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,450
You're tearing
my guts out, claire.

219
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,340
I'm sorry.

220
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,480
Jamie ...

221
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,750
Forgive me.

222
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,640
Forgiven.

223
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,030
I'm sorry, too.

224
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,499
I'll ask your pardon
for what I said.

225
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,010
I was sore
and I said more
than I meant.

226
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,500
Will ye forgive me, too?

227
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,640
Forgiven.

228
00:20:53,915 --> 00:20:56,500
Jamie:  <i>She asked forgiveness</i>
<i>and I gave it.</i>

229
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,040
<i>But the truth is,</i>
<i>I'd forgiven everything</i>
<i>she'd done</i>

230
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:03,200
<i>And everything she could do,</i>
<i>long before that day.</i>

231
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,120
<i>For me,</i>
<i>that was no choice.</i>

232
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,260
<i>That was falling in love.</i>

233
00:21:39,129 --> 00:21:42,359
Looks like we'll be needing
a few more plates, then.

234
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,980
So, while murtagh was

235
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,499
Setting the fuses on the gunpowder,

236
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,960
I sent three of
the bloody jessies
to meet the almighty.

237
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,180
I'm not hearing this.

238
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,791
When I heard the explosion,

239
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:12,846
I thought the
walls of the fort
would come down.

240
00:22:12,871 --> 00:22:15,921
Did ye use yer breath
or yer farts to subdue them?

241
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,500
Are you calling me a liar?

242
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,420
Aye, because ye are lying.
Ye killed nobody.

243
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,610
Oh, oh.

244
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,430
For god's sake, angus!
Sit down..

245
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,000
..stop flapping yer gums.. Use it for
something useful for a change.

246
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,600
Man: I'm not gonna
tell anything if you're taking that tone.

247
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,399
I don't believe
I've properly
thanked all of you.

248
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,500
-For what you did last night.
Ned, have ye got any wine down there?

249
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,600
Ned: Yeah, well,
they do actually
have some rhenish.

250
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,350
Quite nice, if I may say.

251
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,420
It's been a long day.
I'll go upstairs.

252
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,180
She doesna understand
what she nearly cost us.

253
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:05,640
Aye.

254
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,690
And she needs to.

255
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,360
Think they'll ever
speak to me again?

256
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:25,940
Aye.

257
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,490
They will.

258
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,210
Come to bed, Jamie.

259
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,480
I'm afraid we've a matter
Still to settle between us

260
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,410
Before we sleep tonight.

261
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,340
What is it?

262
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,200
If a man among us
had put the rest in danger,

263
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,140
As you did,

264
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,990
He would have likely had
his ears cropped, or been flogged,

265
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,050
If not killed outright.

266
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,170
I didn't know.

267
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,320
Good...

268
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,500
Well, I ken you're not yet
familiar with our ways,

269
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,200
And that's some excuse.

270
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,960
Still, I did tell ye
to stay hid.

271
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,149
And if ye'd done so,
none of this would
have happened.

272
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,430
Now, the british
will be looking
high and low for us.

273
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,320
As for captain randall...

274
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,640
Well, that's
something else again.

275
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,950
He'll be looking for you,

276
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,149
Especially now that
he knows you're here.

277
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:41,490
Aye.

278
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:43,350
He...

279
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,090
It's personal for him.

280
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,370
I am so sorry, jamie.

281
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,270
If it were just me
ye'd hurt by it,

282
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:56,430
I wouldna
say more about it.

283
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,070
But your actions
put all the men
in jeopardy.

284
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,330
Right...

285
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,190
...best get on with it.

286
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,160
Ye've done
considerable damage
disobeying my orders,

287
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,850
And I'm gonna
punish ye for it.

288
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,240
What do you mean?

289
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,450
Oh, you know
fine well what I mean.

290
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,650
Now, get down
by the bed and
lift yer shift, lass.

291
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:37,210
I'll do no such thing.
Now, claire...

292
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,900
I have said I'm sorry.
And I am.

293
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,150
And I will never do
such a thing again.

294
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,480
That's just the point.
You might.

295
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,990
Ye come from a place
where things are easier,
I think.

296
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:54,930
Where it's not a matter
of life and death

297
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,090
If you disobey orders
or take matters into
your own hands.

298
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,830
But it's the hard truth
in places and times
like these that

299
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,950
A light action can have...

300
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,020
...very serious
consequences.

301
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,100
All right.
You're right, of course.

302
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,910
I will obey your orders,
even if I don't
agree with them.

303
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:16,450
Good.

304
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,840
Now then, get off the bed
and we'll get this over with.

305
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,430
What?
I said I would follow your orders.

306
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,949
There's a difference between
understanding something
in yer mind

307
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,680
And really knowing it,
deep down.

308
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,090
I can tell ye from
my own experience

309
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:39,150
That a good hiding
makes ye understand things
In a more serious light.

310
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,340
But as I said,
if it was just me

311
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,360
you put in danger...

312
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,530
But it wasn't.

313
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,750
There's such a thing
as justice, claire.

314
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,070
You've done wrong
to all the men,

315
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,049
And you must suffer for it.

316
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,970
I'm yer husband.
It's my duty to attend to it.

317
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,750
- I will not let you beat me!
You won't?

318
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:02,530
I doubt you'll have
much to say about it.

319
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:09,020
The lad's getting on with it.
Seems so.

320
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,440
That is his duty.

321
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,060
You're my wife, like it or not.
I'll scream!

322
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,050
Well, likely,
if not before,
certainly during!

323
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,570
I expect they'll hear ye
in the next village.

324
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,630
Ye've got good lungs.

325
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:30,040
This'll go faster
if ye just yield, woman.

326
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,800
I'm gonna make you suffer!
Oh!

327
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,880
Well, ye already are.

328
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:39,000
You're taking
pleasure in this,
you barbarian!

329
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,290
Sounds like holy hell up there.
I'm not sure who's punishing who.

330
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,949
I'll never forgive you!

331
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,849
If I can forgive ye
for what you did,

332
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,150
You can forgive me, too,

333
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,410
As soon as ye can
sit down again.

334
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,540
You sadist!
I dinna ken, what's a sadist?

335
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,110
As for my pleasure,

336
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,170
I said I was gonna punish you.
No!

337
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:03,730
I didna say I wasna
gonna enjoy it.

338
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,110
I hope that jamie
wasn't too harsh on
ye last night?

339
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,289
A skelped arse never did anyone
permanent damage.

340
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:22,959
Looks like she gave
as good as she got.

341
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,750
Ah, well, it might not be permanent,
but it hurts like hell.

342
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,750
She'll not make
that mistake again.
Indeed. Yes.

343
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,760
Come and have
a seat here
next to me, lassie.

344
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,870
No, thank you,
I'll stand.

345
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,500
Over there.

346
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:28,855
Ah, it is good to be home.

347
00:29:30,461 --> 00:29:34,611
In the loving bosom of those who hold us dear.
There's no one about.

348
00:29:46,302 --> 00:29:49,065
I do not know about you lot,
but I'm starving!

349
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:51,955
Go after her boy,
I'll keep to the mounts
.

350
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,590
Sassenach.

351
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,400
Claire.

352
00:30:07,786 --> 00:30:09,746
I prefer not to fall behind
my wife.

353
00:30:09,903 --> 00:30:11,003
Then walk faster.

354
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,150
Welcome home, my dears.

355
00:30:34,962 --> 00:30:38,552
It seems like yesterday that you ran
kitchen by steal food.

356
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:41,502
- And now you've gone and married ...
- Leave him be..

357
00:30:41,527 --> 00:30:44,274
Fussin' over him like that...
He'll be no use to anyone...

358
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:45,404
Me especially.

359
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:48,393
You are comin'  back to the stables,
work with horses.

360
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:48,889
Aye.

361
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,650
Congratulations to you both.

362
00:31:15,668 --> 00:31:18,678
I look forward to hearing
all about yer nuptials.

363
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,270
It's been some time
since we've had
a wedding here.

364
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,200
My profound good wishes

365
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,650
For a long and happy
marriage,

366
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,570
Lady Broch Tuarach.

367
00:32:30,964 --> 00:32:32,744
I did not enjoy that one bit.

368
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,874
Did you not notice the look
Colum gave me?

369
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:40,102
It seemed friendly
enough for me.

370
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:42,537
Do not drink anything ...

371
00:32:42,562 --> 00:32:45,382
He did not offer a single toast,
in our honor.

372
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:51,836
What do I know about
clans of manners ?!

373
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,133
Did not you see?

374
00:32:54,703 --> 00:32:56,542
He does not approve of this marriage.

375
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:57,772
He is not alone.

376
00:33:00,055 --> 00:33:02,125
What the hell do you mean by such?

377
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,312
Will you not answer me, Claire?

378
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:16,321
I know what that means!

379
00:33:29,692 --> 00:33:30,862
Happiness is (...).

380
00:33:34,148 --> 00:33:35,068
Who said that?

381
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:37,739
Me.

382
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:41,716
Just now.

383
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:46,590
Yes.

384
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,012
Love.

385
00:33:53,393 --> 00:33:55,003
It is not a simple matter.

386
00:33:55,287 --> 00:33:56,147
It is like...

387
00:33:56,312 --> 00:33:59,712
try to plan for every season
from one moment to the next

388
00:34:00,681 --> 00:34:02,631
And when you
ready for the sun.

389
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:04,836
The ice comes.

390
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,959
What do you know that?

391
00:34:14,982 --> 00:34:17,302
More than you think you ignorant putz.

392
00:34:22,115 --> 00:34:23,325
You mean my mother?

393
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,090
I am a hard man,
Ellen knew it.

394
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:33,116
Your father had a gentle side.

395
00:34:35,655 --> 00:34:37,385
I thought it was a weakness.

396
00:34:38,522 --> 00:34:39,322
I was wrong.

397
00:34:41,983 --> 00:34:44,063
And by the time  I realized that ...

398
00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:48,802
your parents had pledged
themselves to one another.

399
00:34:52,971 --> 00:34:54,631
What's done is done, lad.

400
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:58,366
What do you do next that matters.

401
00:35:02,444 --> 00:35:04,524
Colum awaits you
in his chambers.

402
00:35:07,095 --> 00:35:08,575
Tell him I'm on my way.

403
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:31,820
Pardon.

404
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,990
Why did you do it?

405
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:39,550
I waited for you, Jamie.

406
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:44,400
I was counting the days
till you'd return.

407
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:47,361
I had no notion
about yerself and...

408
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,950
It wasna
something I planned.

409
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,470
Then why?
Why did you do it?

410
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,520
'twas Dougal's
arrangement, ye see.

411
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,770
It's no simple story,
I can tell ye that much.

412
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,410
But an explanation
will have to wait.

413
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,390
Colum summons me.
I must go.

414
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,930
Aye.
Ye canna keep
a Mackenzie waiting.

415
00:36:14,848 --> 00:36:16,288
But we'll speak again.

416
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,410
Aye, you have my word.

417
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,850
Ah. 'tis the bridegroom.

418
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:32,550
Aye.

419
00:36:37,868 --> 00:36:41,508
Now that I have
all three of you weasels
gathered together,

420
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:45,020
Who would like to explain
Fort William?

421
00:36:45,698 --> 00:36:48,089
Is clan Mackenzie
going to have to answer

422
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,849
for yer little raid, hmm?

423
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:53,450
No.

424
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,650
Any repercussions
will land solely on me.

425
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:01,231
Captain Randall
will make sure of that.

426
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:02,960
Fine.

427
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:06,872
Now, back to the rents.

428
00:37:09,493 --> 00:37:11,461
As I say, it has been
a lean year for

429
00:37:11,486 --> 00:37:12,576
for some of the tenants,

430
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:15,071
But we have
much of the stock
still to sell off,

431
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,036
which should help the
balance the scales.

432
00:37:17,061 --> 00:37:19,661
What about
the other money
you collected?

433
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:24,228
The money for
the bonnie Stuart prince Across the water, hmm?

434
00:37:44,249 --> 00:37:46,379
'tis for the Jacobites,
is it not?

435
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:04,380
Did ye not think that
one among the rent party

436
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,600
Would remain
loyal to his laird?

437
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:09,910
Or at least,
young Jamie, here,

438
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:12,995
He does me the honor
of looking fittingly guilty.

439
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:18,824
You mistake
concern for guilt.

440
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,990
My conscience is clear.

441
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,540
I owe no loyalty to
Charlie or James.

442
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,480
He speaks truth, brother.

443
00:38:31,311 --> 00:38:33,551
We merely used
the welts on his back

444
00:38:33,986 --> 00:38:35,906
to illustrate
British justice.

445
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,720
We raised that
gold honorably.

446
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:44,339
We never concealed
the fact from anybody

447
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,007
That we were
raising money
to restore

448
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,052
The rightful king
to his throne.

449
00:38:50,587 --> 00:38:52,087
That, I might remind ye,

450
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,710
Is a cause more important
than any clan or man.

451
00:39:04,786 --> 00:39:05,526
Is that so?

452
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,410
Well, this clan remains
under the charge of this man.

453
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,470
It is still my pleasure To choose
what causes
are supported.

454
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,623
And the
clan Mackenzie's welfare

455
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,728
Comes before
any king or country.

456
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,440
I've proved
my loyalty to you
time and again.

457
00:39:26,593 --> 00:39:30,745
I've collected your rents, I've fought your battles,
I've protected yer person

458
00:39:30,945 --> 00:39:34,475
For the love of Christ, I've even assured
your bloodline!

459
00:39:38,552 --> 00:39:40,512
Now, I think that such fealty is

460
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,920
worth a mere bag of gold,

461
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:46,920
Don't you?

462
00:39:52,843 --> 00:39:53,823
Leave my sight.

463
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:11,360
I shall try to
calm his distemper.

464
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,710
Either that
or I will calm it for him.

465
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:22,987
Perhaps you'd rather
chastise me at a later time?

466
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:23,830
Stay.

467
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,630
I opened my home to you

468
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,810
as sanctuary from the British.

469
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,820
I gave my food,

470
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,990
I gave my hospitality.

471
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,070
Even when you refused
to pledge fealty to me,

472
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,000
I continued to
grant ye quarter
and protection.

473
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,600
And how am I recompensed?

474
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,290
You marry a Sassenach,

475
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,869
Knowing well enough
that none in the clan

476
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:05,070
Will support ye now
as my successor.

477
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,290
I meant no such
betrayal, uncle.

478
00:41:10,611 --> 00:41:13,781
And it will be given you to
opportunity to prove it.

479
00:41:16,408 --> 00:41:18,008
What do you want me to do?

480
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,900
My brother must never
be allowed to succeed me,

481
00:41:32,502 --> 00:41:33,952
as chief of MacKenzies.

482
00:41:50,684 --> 00:41:51,774
Do you not agree?

483
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:56,540
Dougal has,

484
00:41:56,849 --> 00:41:58,666
a fiery temper that
can not be easily ...

485
00:41:58,691 --> 00:42:01,451
Say no more.
I have seen we are in agreement.

486
00:42:02,027 --> 00:42:04,337
I have his replacement
still in mind.

487
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,477
He stands before me.

488
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:11,190
But...

489
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:13,587
But you...

490
00:42:14,162 --> 00:42:15,502
You already declared,

491
00:42:16,086 --> 00:42:18,201
that my marriage precludes me from that honor.

492
00:42:18,224 --> 00:42:19,614
For the time being....

493
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:21,879
A marriage of convenience.

494
00:42:23,183 --> 00:42:25,323
I do not understand
the meaning...

495
00:42:33,445 --> 00:42:34,945
But this is not England.

496
00:42:38,253 --> 00:42:39,873
Life here can be perilous.

497
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:47,732
For whom exactly?

498
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,139
I mentioned no one in particular.

499
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:56,644
Well, for a moment I ...

500
00:42:57,587 --> 00:43:00,307
I was afraid you were speaking about my wife.

501
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,620
And if so...

502
00:43:10,135 --> 00:43:12,715
I will be forced to take
that as a threat.

503
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:17,295
Of course you would.

504
00:43:18,589 --> 00:43:20,779
That is the precise mind of a chief.

505
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,790
Claire: I knew it.

506
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,777
That first time I saw Dougal and hamish
Playing together in the courtyard.

507
00:43:33,977 --> 00:43:34,317
Aye.

508
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,209
Many have gossiped
about it in whispers,

509
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:40,650
And every one of us
in the room
already kent it well.

510
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,417
But that's the first time
I've ever heard

511
00:43:42,442 --> 00:43:44,872
Dougal proclaim
he's Hamish's father.

512
00:43:47,216 --> 00:43:50,626
Thought Colum was going to
run him through right there.

513
00:43:51,137 --> 00:43:53,157
That would solve
a few problems.

514
00:43:53,503 --> 00:43:56,913
Aye, if the storm
canna be calmed
between the brothers,

515
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,975
I'll be the one
to pay the price.

516
00:43:59,175 --> 00:44:02,700
It's hardly the first time
he and Dougal Have been at odds,
god knows.

517
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,360
I'm sure it'll be fine
in the morning.

518
00:44:07,655 --> 00:44:07,995
Aye.

519
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,200
What are you doing?

520
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,860
- I thought ...
- Think again.

521
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,724
(...) it's not your business.

522
00:44:47,082 --> 00:44:48,002
My sweet angel.

523
00:44:55,995 --> 00:44:57,175
You can come out now.

524
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:58,245
Jamie Fraser.

525
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,504
I thought I was hid
well enough.

526
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:10,539
T'was your smell
that gave you away.

527
00:45:14,498 --> 00:45:15,588
A man's sweat.

528
00:45:17,425 --> 00:45:21,425
Couldn't be Arthur.
He's too prissy to ever work up a good lather

529
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:24,601
Yes well...

530
00:45:26,282 --> 00:45:28,282
He holds a postion that does not require much labor.

531
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:35,353
He doesn't do much laboring in any position.
Hmmph!

532
00:45:39,566 --> 00:45:40,616
I saw your new bride.

533
00:45:41,965 --> 00:45:42,315
Earlier

534
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,387
Don't worry Jamie.

535
00:45:50,507 --> 00:45:51,547
She'll recover.

536
00:45:52,328 --> 00:45:53,958
Despite you beating her.

537
00:45:55,177 --> 00:45:56,737
Claire is a strong woman.

538
00:46:02,481 --> 00:46:04,661
But if you ever tan her hide again.

539
00:46:05,248 --> 00:46:06,518
Or ruined her heart.

540
00:46:08,144 --> 00:46:09,064
You'd amazed,

541
00:46:10,346 --> 00:46:12,596
What my concoctions can do to a body.

542
00:46:17,034 --> 00:46:18,414
It would be a shame...

543
00:46:21,731 --> 00:46:23,581
To ruin such a pretty package.

544
00:46:28,572 --> 00:46:30,022
Your husband was right.

545
00:46:33,173 --> 00:46:35,373
You should mind to your own affairs.

546
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,279
Dougal tells ye something,
it's as if it's law.

547
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,536
It is nice reminding you that.

548
00:46:49,561 --> 00:46:51,441
Devil, man.
He's just a lad.

549
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,760
His mouth has been in Colum's ear
And his lips half up his arse!

550
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:00,089
He gave Colum the moneys
collected for the Jacobites.

551
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:03,250
And it wasna his to give.
It wasna Colum's to take.

552
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,110
The Mackenzie
ordered me to do it!

553
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:08,478
I was just serving my oath
to himself as given!

554
00:47:08,678 --> 00:47:10,058
Or would you have me
lie to the laird?

555
00:47:10,217 --> 00:47:13,140
If the Mackenzie
asked you the same, You'd do it,
would you not?

556
00:47:13,326 --> 00:47:15,566
Not after what
he did to Dougal, no.

557
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,390
And what about you, Jamie?

558
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,660
Where does your loyalty lie

559
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:24,416
Between the chief
and the war chief?

560
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,350
Now, there is but one laird
of the clan, is there not?

561
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:33,940
Enough of this blather.
The issue needs no debate.

562
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:37,089
The lad shoulda come to us
For counsel afore taking action.

563
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:40,930
For his disobedience,
He's getting the due
course of punishment.

564
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,450
Besides,
this is Mackenzie
business.

565
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,330
You, Frasers, should
mind to yer own.

566
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:51,440
Now, stand aside and let us get back to ours.
Hey.

567
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,600
What's all this, then?

568
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:01,330
I thought we were
hunting stag?

569
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:03,910
Aye.

570
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,150
Who's with me?

571
00:49:01,926 --> 00:49:03,466
I ken I'd find you here.

572
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:09,646
This has been your secret place
since ye were a lad.

573
00:49:11,322 --> 00:49:13,732
Not so secret
if you find me so easily.

574
00:49:16,614 --> 00:49:18,354
You promised we would speak.

575
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:20,349
Aye,

576
00:49:24,804 --> 00:49:27,864
I remember the first time
I saw you, James Fraser,

577
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:30,630
Comin' through
the gates of Leoch.

578
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,480
It was only seven years old,
still a child.

579
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:36,460
You didn't notice back then..

580
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:39,609
..how my heart lept when you were near.

581
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:43,051
..and you went away, all those years.

582
00:49:43,826 --> 00:49:45,036
I never forgot you.

583
00:49:47,044 --> 00:49:47,894
I'm wed now.

584
00:49:49,494 --> 00:49:51,564
And 'twas
a gallant thing ye did.

585
00:49:52,403 --> 00:49:55,420
Marrying the Sassenach
to spare her from the british.

586
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:59,059
'tis true the marriage
was Dougal's
arrangement, but...

587
00:50:04,009 --> 00:50:05,109
You dinna look...

588
00:50:05,939 --> 00:50:06,689
very happy.

589
00:50:08,162 --> 00:50:11,322
Ye look like
ye're carrying the
world on yer back.

590
00:50:17,096 --> 00:50:19,302
- Laoghaire ...
- When you returned ...

591
00:50:19,502 --> 00:50:22,612
When you took the beating
for me in the great hall,

592
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,349
I knew I wasn't wrong.

593
00:50:26,088 --> 00:50:27,528
That you felt the same.

594
00:50:29,281 --> 00:50:31,471
And then,
that day in the alcove ...

595
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:36,779
The way you kissed me.

596
00:50:41,277 --> 00:50:42,727
She was married before.

597
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:47,929
But I've lain with no one.

598
00:50:49,843 --> 00:50:50,513
I want ye

599
00:50:53,992 --> 00:50:54,962
to be the first

600
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,520
And only one to have me.

601
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:07,049
No.

602
00:51:08,642 --> 00:51:10,862
I made a vow
and I'll not break it.

603
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,180
Even for a lass
as bonnie as you.

604
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:19,547
I'm sorry.

605
00:51:29,872 --> 00:51:30,612
I'm sorry!

606
00:52:07,086 --> 00:52:08,296
- Where is Dougal?
-

607
00:52:26,878 --> 00:52:29,298
How do you stop
two dogs from fightin'?

608
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:47,326
Bastard!

609
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:50,599
It's over!

610
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:54,111
No! No!

611
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,009
drink as friends?

612
00:53:01,123 --> 00:53:03,683
Murtagh, get these good lads some whiskey!

613
00:53:25,934 --> 00:53:29,646
You settled that scirmash like
a future leader of the MacKenzies.

614
00:53:29,846 --> 00:53:36,237
There's a reason you're not know for your sense of humor.
Well if it's plain talk you're after...
Here's something you could chew off.

615
00:53:36,437 --> 00:53:38,507
It's getting a wee bit uncomfortable
around  here

616
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,460
for my taste.

617
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,260
Rupert's right.
This is not our fight.

618
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,700
I'll saddle the horses.
Ye take hold of Claire

619
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,740
And we'll be away
from here this very night.

620
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:53,230
And how would we live?

621
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,819
Horrocks was
my best chance,

622
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:57,767
And now,
I may be even
an outlaw for good.

623
00:53:57,792 --> 00:53:59,342
We'll live off the land.

624
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,750
Or has castle life
made ye soft?

625
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,950
Would ye have me sleeping under a tree
Come winter with my wife?

626
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,200
Leave her, then.

627
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,350
We can send for the lass
when we find safe beds.

628
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,910
Aye, spoken like
the unwed man ye are.

629
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,497
For pity's sake, Jamie,

630
00:54:15,697 --> 00:54:17,587
It's either up tail and away,

631
00:54:17,651 --> 00:54:19,301
or we stay and pick a side.

632
00:54:19,431 --> 00:54:22,881
It's not like Colum's
gonna give
Dougal back the gold.

633
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:27,599
Not that I see
that it matters much
either way.

634
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,020
The bonnie prince
isna sailing from
Italy anytime soon.

635
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:31,970
No,

636
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,490
He isna, is he?

637
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,090
Peace, you say? Peace?

638
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,520
You come here and tell me

639
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,729
That clansman brawls
with clansman!

640
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,489
That my own brother
defies me.

641
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:52,020
How can there be peace
until such disloyalty
is punished?

642
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:54,062
Well, chastising the guilty
might sooth yer anger,

643
00:54:54,087 --> 00:54:56,119
But I doubt
it will accomplish
anything more.

644
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,749
The bad blood will only fester,
leading to more violence,

645
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,360
Until the clan explodes
into open warfare.

646
00:55:02,531 --> 00:55:04,141
What would you have me do?

647
00:55:07,276 --> 00:55:10,046
Make yer brother a gift
of the Jacobite gold.

648
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,650
You'd have me commit
treason to the crown?

649
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:15,935
Sanctiona stuart restoration
to the throne?

650
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,238
A stuart restoration
is but an airy hope,
my laird.

651
00:55:18,263 --> 00:55:19,883
There is no Jacobite army.

652
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,469
The highland clans are too busy reiving
each other's cattle

653
00:55:22,494 --> 00:55:24,064
To even consider uniting.

654
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,070
While bonnie prince charlie
lounges idly,

655
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:30,000
Being pampered
by the pope.

656
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,470
Aye. Aye, all that is true.

657
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,670
Meanwhile, my own clan teeters
on the brink of civil war.

658
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,240
Then remove the source
of the immediate conflict.

659
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,899
Give Dougal back the gold
And ye pacify him

660
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,120
and his companions.

661
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,160
Let yer brother
play the rebel,

662
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,390
As long as
he does it quietly.

663
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:57,490
Let him whisper
of a free Scotland for now,

664
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,000
While you bide your time

665
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,510
And wait to see
how events transpire.

666
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,370
If bonnie prince charlie
ever returns with
a call to arms,

667
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,990
You can decide then
which side to back.

668
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:14,400
Dougal may be war chief,

669
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,450
But he knows only you
can cry for war.

670
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:30,950
Bring my brother
and Ned Gowan here.

671
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,770
Are we to
stand here all day,

672
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:06,330
Or is there a purpose
to this summons?

673
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,600
One day, brother,

674
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,940
You'll talk your
head off your shoulders

675
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,580
And right onto a pike.

676
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,200
A month ago,

677
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,440
You swore an oath
to me on this dirk.

678
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:44,640
Ye recall?

679
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:46,640
Aye.

680
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,270
So tell me, brother,

681
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:52,110
What's a man's
word worth these days?

682
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,640
A bag of gold, perhaps?

683
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,300
My oath to youis an oath to
Scotland.

684
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,990
I've not broken it,
nor will I ever.

685
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:10,140
We'll see.

686
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,780
Go on, then.
Play the rebel.

687
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,680
See where it leads ye.

688
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:51,455
I thank you, brother.

689
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,450
Ned, send a missiveto the
Duke of Sandringham,

690
00:58:56,906 --> 00:58:59,376
Inviting him
to a banquet
in his honor.

691
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:02,869
Best warn the men of the household
To keep their arses out of his reach.

692
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:06,980
Sweet christ, man, Can ye not keep
that tongue of yers From wagging?

693
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:10,830
Very wise, laird, To get the measure
of the Jacobite cause

694
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:13,500
From an Englishman's
perspective.

695
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,189
It will take more
than yer approval

696
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:18,509
To get back
in my good graces,
ned gowan.

697
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:20,860
Get out of my sight,
all three of you.

698
00:59:41,984 --> 00:59:44,194
Colum and Dougal have mended fences.

699
00:59:49,849 --> 00:59:51,049
It's not worth it.

700
00:59:51,313 --> 00:59:56,003
It is best to leave them alone.
There are no shortage of Highlanders at Leoch.

701
00:59:58,484 --> 01:00:01,424
That's not the company I crave last week as well

702
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:09,168
Our lives in the Highlands
are steeped in traditions

703
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:11,230
customs and rituals.

704
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:14,150
So I've seen.
And Colum chose
to risk looking weak,

705
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:16,330
Publicly changing
his position,

706
01:00:16,852 --> 01:00:19,692
Because peace was
more important
than custom.

707
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,530
I saw a rigid man bend.

708
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:26,750
It made me mindful.

709
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:31,300
About what?

710
01:00:35,859 --> 01:00:37,489
Wives obey their husbands.

711
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:41,349
Husbands discipline them
when they don't.

712
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,550
Well, that's how
it was with my father,

713
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:46,270
And his father and on
and on and on back.

714
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,290
But maybe, for you and me,
it has to go a different way.

715
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,300
I swear on the cross
of my lord jesus,

716
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,510
And by the holy iron
which I hold

717
01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:17,120
That I give you my fealty
and pledge you my loyalty.

718
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:21,430
If ever my hand is raised
In rebellion against you again,

719
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:24,550
I pray that this holy iron
Might pierce my heart.

720
01:01:37,484 --> 01:01:39,044
Is it not enough, Claire?

721
01:01:42,623 --> 01:01:44,343
Do you not
want me anymore?

722
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:53,338
Do you wish to
live separately?

723
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:57,540
Well, that's what
I should want...

724
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:11,180
But I don't.

725
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:23,820
The key to Lallybroch.

726
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:25,950
What?

727
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:28,930
Yer ring.

728
01:02:32,746 --> 01:02:35,866
I had the blacksmith Fashion your ring
from my key.

729
01:02:41,813 --> 01:02:45,433
Why didn't you tell me that before,
When you gave it to me?

730
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:50,290
I wanted to wait
until I took ye back
to lallybroch.

731
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:54,410
So ye'd know the place
was as much yours as mine.

732
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:59,740
But now, I dinna
ken when, if ever,
we'll get back there.

733
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,080
Jamie, I...
And that...

734
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:06,580
That thought
does not pain me

735
01:03:08,123 --> 01:03:10,013
As much as it
once might have.

736
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,540
It is my home now.

737
01:03:43,203 --> 01:03:44,413
I want you, Claire.

738
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,770
I love you so much
I can hardly breathe.

739
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:54,500
Will ye have me?

740
01:03:58,190 --> 01:03:59,740
Yes. Yes, I'll have you.

741
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,140
Listen to me.

742
01:04:55,886 --> 01:04:58,176
If you ever raise
a hand to me again,

743
01:04:59,523 --> 01:05:00,393
James Fraser,

744
01:05:01,474 --> 01:05:04,644
I will cut your heart out
and have it for breakfast.

745
01:05:05,257 --> 01:05:06,587
Do you understand me?

746
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,060
Do you?
You have my word.

747
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:27,830
You're mine.
<i>Mo nighean donn.</i>

748
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:31,000
Mine, now and forever.

749
01:05:41,122 --> 01:05:43,472
And I mean to make you
call me master.

750
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:45,170
I am your master
and you're mine.

751
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,970
It seems that I can not
possess your soul

752
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,190
without losing my own.

753
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:22,210
Sassenach.

754
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:26,540
Yes, master?

755
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:30,640
What does "fucking" mean?

756
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:35,680
- What?
"fucking."

757
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,150
After Fort William

758
01:07:39,650 --> 01:07:41,790
you called me
a "fucking bastard".

759
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:46,970
Well, that means
what we just did..

760
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:54,680
What about "sadist"?
Ye called me that as well.

761
01:07:57,368 --> 01:08:02,448
Well, that means someone
Who takes sexual pleasure

762
01:08:02,942 --> 01:08:04,162
in hurting someone.

763
01:08:07,799 --> 01:08:10,229
Oh, well.
Ye dinna flatter me overmuch,

764
01:08:11,226 --> 01:08:13,696
But I canna fault
yer observations.
Um...

765
01:08:27,860 --> 01:08:29,470
Oh. Was I too rough on you?

766
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:32,600
Well, If you bed a vixen,

767
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:36,700
you have to expect to get bit.

768
01:08:38,409 --> 01:08:40,079
Come here and
bite me some more.

769
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:50,349
I'm ravenous.
Hmm. So am I.

770
01:09:00,877 --> 01:09:02,087
You meant food.
Mmm-hmm.

771
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,970
I'll go to the kitchen,
fetch us something to eat.

772
01:09:19,951 --> 01:09:20,811
What on earth is this?

773
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:27,600
Where'd ye get that?
- It was just there.

774
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,090
What's wrong?
What is it?

775
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:34,100
It's an ill-wish.

776
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:37,300
Which is?

777
01:09:40,039 --> 01:09:42,339
It's meant to bring
pain or harm

778
01:09:44,704 --> 01:09:45,624
or even death.

779
01:09:47,438 --> 01:09:49,618
Who would put
such a thing
under our bed?

780
01:09:52,069 --> 01:09:52,529
Jamie?

781
01:09:58,050 --> 01:09:58,750
Laoghaire.
