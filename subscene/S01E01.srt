Selamat Pagi semuanya.

21
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,960
Memulai Kasus tentang
Andrew dan Olivia Baker

22
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,546
Melawan sekolah Evergreen County
 

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,299
apa kedua pihak sudah siap?

24
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,471
dia sangat cantik.

25
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:41,143
dan dia juga sangat baik.

26
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:46,189
Tyler, kamu bersaksi bahwa hidup
di lingkungan Liberty High School sangat buruk

27
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,025
sebelum Hannah Baker bunuh diru.

28
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:48,984
Bagaimana sekarang?

29
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:52,863
Tyler?

30
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,408
Lebih buruk lagi.

31
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:07,919
Hey! hati hati dong!

32
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,256
- Whoa!
- Hey!

33
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,176
sudah 5 bulan
semenjak Hannah Baker bunuh diri.

34
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,803
Kami tidak pernah mengira bahwa persidangan ini akan terjadi.

35
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,348
kami pikir ini akan cepat berlalu.

36
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:25,479
tetapi ketika saya dipanggil untuk bersaksi,
itu membuatku sadar bahwa ini semua tidak seperti itu.

37
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,987
Segalanya sudah berbeda sekarang.

38
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:47,125
Jangan menerobos lampu merah?
kamu sudah janji.

39
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,753
Aku sudah janji banyak hal padamu.

40
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,380
kamu udah dapet ktp?

41
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,302
"Cody Jantzen" dari Texas.

42
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,929
dan apakah kamu siap untuk ini?

43
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,307
siap dong. capek uy ngetiknya wkkwkw

44
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,852
It's like you said, it'll help me
put that part of my life to rest.

45
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,230
-It shows I found closure--
-Yeah. Totally.

46
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,441
But I meant, are you ready for the needle?

47
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,862
Breathe deep. Stay calm.

48
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,032
I'm good, I'm fine.

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,618
It's his first time.

50
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:23,870
Really?

51
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,708
So, the semi-colon,
it's for a friend of yours?

52
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,086
Yeah. Yeah.

53
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:32,963
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,507
Thanks.

55
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,261
Half done.

56
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,015
Wow.

57
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,936
Sweet. All right, cool.

58
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,105
Yeah, keep going.

59
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,903
The truth is,
everyone's still hurting.

60
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,198
Some more than others.

61
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,370
Oh, shit.

62
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,957
It's a fucking comma.

63
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,710
So it signifies a pause.

64
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,964
As in, you paused getting a tattoo
in order to faint.

65
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,551
Even just getting the tattoo,
I fucking fail.

66
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,096
Hey.

67
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,016
Hannah will forgive you.

68
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,814
Look, I'm not--
I'm not thinking about her.

69
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,316
-It's okay if you are.
-I'm not.

70
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,234
I haven't for months now.

71
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,903
Okay.

72
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,615
And there's not gonna be a trial,
her folks are gonna settle,

73
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,535
Bryce'll get away with it,
and you know, fuck it all.

74
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:46,870
Fuck the world.

75
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,916
All I care about is you.

76
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,176
Maybe we try to convince ourselves
we're over it.

77
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,221
Maybe it works for a while.

78
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:06,932
Sure you're ready for this?

79
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,769
Are you sure you are? I've done it before.

80
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,354
Yeah, I'm ready, I mean...

81
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,858
I have been, and I am today. Ready.

82
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,527
-Okay.
-Yeah.

83
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,705
-Is this okay?
-Yes.

84
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,508
-What is that?
-It's nothing.

85
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,052
-Keep going.
-Wait, those are cuts.

86
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,014
-You cut down there?
-I used to, a long time ago.

87
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,307
But those are recent.

88
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:54,980
You're supposed to call me
if you even just think about it.

89
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,148
Where are your rubber bands?
Have you been trying meditation?

90
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,151
Meditation is the most fucking
boring thing in the world.

91
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,029
Then we're going to take
a mindfulness walk.

92
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,991
I'm fucking serious, Skye.

93
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,744
I will do whatever I have to do.
I will text you every hour.

94
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,706
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

95
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,792
I promise I'll call.

96
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:18,712
Okay.

97
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,050
I tried not thinking about it.

98
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,887
Some days I was able to shut it all out
and live my life.

99
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,015
Some days I wasn't.

100
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,941
But then I got home last night
and got news I wasn't expecting.

101
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,159
- How's Skye?
- She's good.

102
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,328
You should invite her in.

103
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,122
We haven't seen her since,
what, the seventh grade?

104
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,126
-She hasn't really changed.
-We'll have her over for dinner.

105
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,548
-Um, Skye doesn't really do dinner.
-She doesn't eat?

106
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,677
I mean, no, she eats,
just not in situations with parents.

107
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,639
Clay, I need to talk to you
about the trial.

108
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,310
What? What trial?

109
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,563
Hannah's trial. It's moving forward.

110
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:19,814
What?

111
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,444
-You told me it was settled.
-We thought it was.

112
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,989
But the Bakers rejected
the district's final offer today.

113
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,699
It starts tomorrow.

114
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,913
Tomorrow? How is that possible?

115
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,875
They were up against the trial date.

116
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,252
At the last minute,
the Bakers rejected the settlement.

117
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,007
So, I'll get to testify about Bryce?

118
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,095
Sonya did tell me
that you're not on either witness list.

119
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,389
Why not?

120
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,809
Clay, each side chooses witnesses
based on a variety of factors.

121
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,352
Bryce raped Hannah.

122
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,605
Why is nobody talking about that?
You heard his confession.

123
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,691
You heard everything,
before you dropped out.

124
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,234
I didn't drop out of the case.

125
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:07,946
I withdrew because your involvement
created a conflict of interest.

126
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,532
Well, I'm not involved anymore,
so can someone do something?

127
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,367
If we knew the girl on tape nine.

128
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,369
Mom, it's not my place to tell you that.

129
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:19,040
-If she would come forward--
-This is a fucking joke. He confessed!

130
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,042
Clay, I'm worried about your anger.

131
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,506
You're worried about my anger?
That's what you're worried about?

132
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,594
I'm not angry, Mom. I'm fine.

133
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,222
That's why you're never home?

134
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,391
We had a deal.

135
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,979
I've had perfect attendance, kept up
my grades, I get to have a life of my own.

136
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:45,066
The deal was that you would be safe.
You put a lock on your door.

137
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,277
Which you found out by trying to open it?

138
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:52,157
Clay, I know this is going to be
very hard for you.

139
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,616
It's not.

140
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,872
I haven't thought about Hannah in months.
So I'll just keep on like that.

141
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,158
This trial going forward,

142
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,410
it affects the whole town.

143
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,871
We have to think about it all over again,

144
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,956
how Hannah lived and how she died.

145
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,337
And how it changed all our lives.

146
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,562
-Hey, buddy.
-Hey, Dad.

147
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:09,150
So, your mom isn't too happy
about you going back to school tomorrow.

148
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,152
Well, I have to go back with Jessica.

149
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:14,948
We promised we'd go back together,
and she's going back tomorrow.

150
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,951
Okay, but we were thinking
more like a week, maybe two?

151
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,619
Dad, it has to be now.

152
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,163
- 'Cause of the trial?
- Yeah.

153
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:25,792
And I know people have been
talking about me for months now.

154
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,961
-Who's been talking?
-It's a small town, Dad.

155
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,297
I can't even go outside
without people looking at me.

156
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,133
Or talking about what I did.

157
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,762
Or what Hannah did and I failed to do.
And I'm sick of hiding from them all.

158
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,723
You're not hiding from anyone.
You're recuperating.

159
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,309
I can still do that. Just out there.

160
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,188
And Hannah's trial means
people are finally gonna hear her story,

161
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,690
and I want to help tell it.

162
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,401
Okay. Well, you keep pushing ahead.

163
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,155
I'll tell the boss lady
you're feeling stronger.

164
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,032
Good work today, by the way.

165
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,202
You think I'll get to testify?

166
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,999
I don't know. I think that's up
to your doctors and the court.

167
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,917
Okay? Get some sleep.

168
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,044
I love you.

169
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,058
Hey, what'd they say?

170
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:29,480
-I can go. How about you?
-They don't like it, but they said yes.

171
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,399
This trial has me freaked out.

172
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:36,529
What have people been saying about us?
What do they know?

173
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,615
We're gonna find out.

174
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,783
Jess...

175
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,494
Look, whatever happens,
we're gonna stick to the plan.

176
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,121
I don't remember what happened to me,

177
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,207
just like you don't remember
what happened to you.

178
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,250
-Right?
-Right.

179
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,213
You feel okay about seeing Bryce again?

180
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,093
Yeah. Totally.

181
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,152
You hurt.

182
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:20,615
Worse, you feel... powerless.

183
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,421
I know some people don't want us
to talk about what happened...

184
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,805
but if we don't talk about it,
it's never going to change.

185
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,771
So it's important for everyone
to understand how it all happened.

186
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,440
The whole story, you know?

187
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,002
Because things at Liberty
are as bad as they've ever been.

188
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,670
Mom, it's gonna be fine.

189
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,757
No, I don't mind being the first kid
to testify. I want to be the first.

190
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,763
Yeah. I told the lawyers that. I know.

191
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:27,890
Yeah, I know.

192
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,730
All right, look,
I'll be home soon. Okay? Bye.

193
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,150
And I don't want to be afraid anymore.

194
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,620
I don't want to be afraid.

195
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,209
I don't know why this case
is going forward.

196
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:57,170
I don't why you need to be the first.

197
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,715
-The way these kids abuse you--
-That's why I have to be first.

198
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,552
They want me to talk
about how things are at school,

199
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,180
and somebody has to do that.

200
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,099
It's very brave of you, Tyler,
to want to do this for Hannah.

201
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,185
It's not just for Hannah, okay?

202
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,730
It's for me, and Alex, and...

203
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,901
and I have to.

204
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,822
Okay, your dad's on a double and they have
extra units outside the courthouse.

205
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:28,618
If you need anything, call me, okay?
I can get coverage if I have to.

206
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,706
Mom, did I leave a note?

207
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,337
Yes. You left a note.

208
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,172
I want to see it.

209
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,384
Alex, honey, I--
I don't know that you're ready to--

210
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,803
What? To know the truth?
Or know why I did it?

211
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,307
Is this that you don't want me
to think about it

212
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,601
or you just don't want to talk about it?

213
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:58,189
It's my goddamn note, Mom,
I want to see it!

214
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,818
-What, did you throw it away?
-Of course we didn't throw it away.

215
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,115
Okay. How about I give it to you
the next time you see Dr. Ellman?

216
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:12,703
God. Mom, I promise you,
I'll talk to him about it. Please.

217
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,768
Do you want to talk about it?

218
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,733
Um...

219
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,112
What does this mean?

220
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,948
"I could have stopped it."
What does that mean?

221
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,200
How could I have stopped it?

222
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,328
It just means
that you felt terrible guilt.

223
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:59,584
That you felt responsible, but that
is too much for any one person to take on.

224
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,169
You know that now, right?

225
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,423
"I could have stopped it."

226
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:09,677
Good morning.

227
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,055
Are you ready for battle?

228
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:17,143
Is anyone ever really ready
for something like this?

229
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,687
You are. We are.

230
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:28,696
Thank you, Jackie, for being here.
Truly, it's above and beyond.

231
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,822
This is what I do.

232
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,327
I'll be the only one in that room
who truly knows what you're going through.

233
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,830
Remember that. I will be your strength.

234
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,292
I'm not afraid. I'm not.

235
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:46,130
I mean, for so long, I've...
I've dreaded this day, but now I'm just...

236
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,966
-I'm angry.
-Mm-hm.

237
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,845
-I'm angry. At everyone.
-Good.

238
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:54,138
Hold on to that.

239
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,642
And your husband,
were you able to convince him to--?

240
00:16:58,893 --> 00:16:59,727
No.

241
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,318
Part of me didn't want
to come to court today.

242
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,488
But I knew I had to be here.

243
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,157
For Hannah.

244
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:14,867
For her mom.

245
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,622
For everyone who gets bullied

246
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,041
while Liberty still lets them
get away with it.

247
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,629
Guys like Scott Reed,
Montgomery De La Cruz, Bryce Walker.

248
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,049
- Thought it was gonna settle.
- Don't worry about it.

249
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,930
-What, is that Cory Jensen gonna testify?
-Clay.

250
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,391
Don't know, don't care.

251
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,604
Yeah, all that Hannah Baker shit

252
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,231
will get dredged up all over again.

253
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,441
My dad's got the trial covered.

254
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,361
We'll figure it out.

255
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,614
Now fucking Jessica Davis
is coming back to Liberty?

256
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:57,076
-Is that a coincidence or what?
-Again, man. Don't know, don't care.

257
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,788
Don't worry about the fucking trial, man.

258
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,419
I want them to hear
Hannah's voice.

259
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,506
-We've talked about this.
-But, Dennis, I want them to hear

260
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,592
-the pain she was in.
-Olivia,

261
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:16,053
we'd have to argue best evidence
just to get the tapes admitted.

262
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:19,348
-But Tony gave us the cassettes.
-Yes, and if one goes in, they all go in.

263
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,101
We can't get Porter
without getting Hannah drunk.

264
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:24,979
Hannah taking her shirt off,
leaving the scene of a crime.

265
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:28,774
-All right, what about Bryce Walker?
-Again, we start with the school first.

266
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:31,902
It doesn't help to bring him
and his father's legal team into it.

267
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,946
He raped her. The school knew about it.

268
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,074
And unless there's corroboration,
it's his word against hers.

269
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,828
We have to establish a pattern of activity
that the school was aware of.

270
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,541
We're starting with Tyler Down...?

271
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,836
Because he can speak to the climate
of bullying at Liberty.

272
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,006
And because we had yesterday
to get subpoenas out.

273
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,591
I know. I'm sorry, Dennis.

274
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,261
Just, when they put the NDA
back on the table, I couldn't stay silent.

275
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,390
Hannah's story needs to be told.

276
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,727
And we're gonna tell it.

277
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,190
Each day in this trial,
you're gonna hear testimony

278
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,567
from students who knew Hannah Baker
at Liberty High,

279
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:15,821
from adults at Liberty,
from Hannah's own parents.

280
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:20,660
You'll hear about a girl in crisis,
a poisonous school culture,

281
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,495
and an administration

282
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,998
that could have averted a tragedy,
but didn't.

283
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,044
You'll hear about a beautiful,
innocent, sensitive girl

284
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,505
who was bullied to death.

285
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:37,301
And for every story you hear
about a precious girl that we've lost,

286
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,262
there are stories of the living.

287
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,685
There are lives in the balance.
Justice must be done.

288
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,605
For Hannah,
and for those who are still suffering.

289
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,401
There's more than one side
to every story.

290
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,904
The plaintiffs will tell you
what they believe to be Hannah's story,

291
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,281
but nothing is as simple as it seems.

292
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:01,742
No one is just a victim.

293
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:07,832
Her parents want to blame the school,
but there's plenty of blame to go around.

294
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,461
You'll hear the full story.
And you'll make up your own mind.

295
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,386
- See you later. Bye.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

296
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,389
Hey.

297
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,686
-You look beautiful today.
-So do you.

298
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,605
-I look damaged.
-It's a good look on you.

299
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:35,985
-See, everybody's checking you out.
-They're checking you out.

300
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,988
You're pretty and sad. People love that.

301
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,283
You have a cane and a scar.
All my scars are inside.

302
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:46,328
We're definitely going to hell
for joking about this.

303
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:50,624
Alex, my friend, we're in hell already.
I plan to look like I'm enjoying it.

304
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,049
They're looking at you more.

305
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,844
They're looking at you more.

306
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,846
Which one of us is more tragic?

307
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,682
Ryan should do another one
of his stupid polls.

308
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,770
-I'll take that.
-I can carry my own books.

309
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,939
Well, clearly you can't,
so let me help, don't be a dick.

310
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,566
- And welcome back.
- Thank you.

311
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,611
I meant to ask you guys about my note.

312
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,906
-What note?
-My suicide note.

313
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,784
-Jesus, put that away.
-It's not radioactive.

314
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:29,705
No, I know, it's just...
we're not allowed to talk about suicide.

315
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,791
Or you. Or Hannah.

316
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,169
-Says who?
-Says the school.

317
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:37,546
They made a rule the day after you...

318
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,299
after that day.

319
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:44,011
And if you talk about it on campus,
you get suspended.

320
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,680
-That's so fucked up.
-Yeah.

321
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,017
- Oh, shit.
- They find you in the hallway...

322
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,353
Let's go. Who do you have
first period? Mr. Wood?

323
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,605
Yeah. I can't turn that fast.

324
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,649
-What are you running from, Zach?
-Nothing.

325
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,444
Hey! Jess, Alex, welcome back, you guys.

326
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:05,449
-'Sup, Alex? Jess.
-Seriously? "Welcome back"?

327
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,453
Alex, stop. I'll see you guys after third.

328
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,540
I'm gonna take the long way.
It's gonna be a good day.

329
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,127
I told you not to do that, man.

330
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,797
They act like they own the school.

331
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,599
Hey, man. You okay?

332
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,309
They get in your head...

333
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:33,727
I'm fine.

334
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,857
People tell lies about you,
and other people believe them.

335
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,322
And it gets to the point where...

336
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,742
the lies might as well be the truth.

337
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,370
And did people tell lies
about Hannah Baker?

338
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,624
Yes, they did. All the time.

339
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,297
And another girl I know,

340
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,801
she had something happen to her.

341
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,392
She had to leave school for a while.

342
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,980
While she was gone,
the story got totally twisted.

343
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,990
They know Justin accused Bryce
of raping her.

344
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,952
But after Justin left
and Jessica stopped coming to school,

345
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,829
Bryce just spun the whole story.

346
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,583
He said they that hooked up
and that she, like, wanted it.

347
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,211
What?
Then why would Justin say all that shit?

348
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,340
Bryce said Jessica felt bad
for cheating on Justin with him.

349
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,842
Such a fucking asshole.

350
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,261
With you guys coming back,
maybe it's best that we...

351
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,847
just don't poke the bear, you know?

352
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:56,226
-Let's try to get things back to normal.
-I don't think there is a normal anymore.

353
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,413
Be seated, please. Two minutes.

354
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,334
Tyler, in your deposition,
you said you took pictures of Hannah.

355
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,460
Yes, I did.

356
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,922
And it upset her
and I felt terrible about it.

357
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:29,134
But isn't it true that Hannah actually
enjoyed having you take her picture?

358
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:34,556
-What?
-Defense exhibit B.

359
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,266
Tyler...

360
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,896
did you take these pictures?

361
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:45,901
Um...

362
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:48,737
yes.

363
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,240
Yeah, I did. I did.

364
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:55,369
And was this before or after
Hannah was allegedly bullied?

365
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:58,497
I guess, before.

366
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,418
-And how did you come to take them?
-I, um...

367
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,383
It was the first day of school.

368
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:11,802
Sophomore year.

369
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,851
I was the Student Life photographer.

370
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:24,940
I was trying to get candids, you know,
everyone still in their summer tan.

371
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,193
Hey, guys. Hey, uh, yearbook?

372
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,279
-Yeah, fuck it, whatever.
-Cool.

373
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,657
Football team. Looking good, guys.

374
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,454
What? They were special memories.

375
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:40,998
-Thanks, guys.
-It's bad enough we gotta--

376
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,333
Oh.

377
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:47,337
-That's that new girl.
-Yeah, Hannah Baker.

378
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:48,922
She's fucking hot.

379
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:52,259
-Smile, girls.
-Gross. Tyler, go away.

380
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:53,927
It's for yearbook.

381
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,559
Hey. Shoot me.

382
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,062
-What?
-Shoot me and the locker that won't open.

383
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,192
Yeah. Yeah, all right. Um...

384
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,032
Uh, here, I can actually help with this.

385
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,117
I'm Hannah.

386
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,955
I saw you at Kat's party, actually,
which I think was at your house.

387
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:26,001
-Yeah, it was.
-Sorry, this is just-- Cool.

388
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,755
-Thank you.
-Yeah. No worries.

389
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:34,301
-And your name is?
-Oh, um, Tyler. Tyler, yeah.

390
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:39,348
Uh, would you ever want to, I don't know,
do a photo shoot or something?

391
00:26:41,225 --> 00:26:42,059
Sure.

392
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,478
I told her to come camera-ready.

393
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,980
Whoa. Isn't that a little much?

394
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:52,194
-You want to have a light touch. Classy.
-It's for a photo shoot.

395
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,740
Where, in a brothel?
Just take it down a notch. Okay?

396
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,450
Don't want people getting the wrong idea.

397
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,750
I could tell she had been crying.
I wasn't sure why.

398
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,213
She didn't need the makeup anyway.

399
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,591
She was so beautiful.

400
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,555
And she was so nice to me.

401
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,182
I'm sorry, I'm not camera-ready.

402
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,226
Sure you are. It's good. You're good.

403
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,894
Thanks.

404
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:31,525
Look, the whole point is to capture you
as who you are, okay?

405
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,693
Yeah. Okay. Cool.

406
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:34,611
Yeah.

407
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,114
So, should we...?

408
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,616
I wondered who made her cry.

409
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:43,453
Who made her feel like that
when she only ever deserved to be happy?

410
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,748
Yes. Okay, keep that up.

411
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,755
Wow, you're... you're really amazing.

412
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,883
-Thank you for doing this.
-Uh...

413
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,302
-Thank you for asking.
-Of course.

414
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:00,470
Perfect.

415
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,390
But like I said,
the picture's only part of the story.

416
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,852
From these, it seemed that Hannah
liked having her picture taken.

417
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,562
Well, I mean, that day--

418
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,899
You didn't tell us about that day.
What else are you not telling us?

419
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:14,276
- Objection, argumentative.
- Withdrawn.

420
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:18,655
Tyler, isn't it true that no real bullying
resulted from any of the photos you took?

421
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,240
No, it's not true.

422
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,534
I spread around a picture of Hannah.

423
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,121
And then Clay Jensen did the same to me.

424
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:29,750
But how could that be bullying
if Hannah liked the attention?

425
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,713
I mean, she... she liked it then.

426
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,966
But when Justin and those guys
sent that picture around...

427
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,386
it told a story that wasn't true.

428
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,556
-Oh, hey, Hannah. What's up?
-Hey, can I talk to you?

429
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,187
I wanted to let her know
I'd been there too.

430
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:54,066
I wanted to tell Hannah
I saw her for who she really was.

431
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,734
Hey, Hannah.

432
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,904
What? What do you want?

433
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,114
Um...

434
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:05,744
Look, I just, I mean, I know
that there's this picture going around--

435
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,412
Yeah, there is. Thank you.

436
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,875
Look, I just wanted to say to you, um...

437
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,504
you're the most beautiful girl at Liberty.

438
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,714
If you want to do another photo shoot--

439
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,176
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Get away from me.

440
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:24,137
I knew I had said the wrong thing.

441
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,723
I always say the wrong thing.

442
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:31,144
I printed out all the best photos
from the shoot,

443
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,147
so she could see how beautiful she was.

444
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:37,359
Even if kids at school wanted to see her
as a slut or whatever.

445
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,697
And I wanted to give them to her,
as like, a gift.

446
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:51,123
But she was with... a boy.

447
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:57,796
And then I got shy, and I hid from them.

448
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,047
Have a good night.

449
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,543
I took out my camera,
just so I could get a better look.

450
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:39,588
And...

451
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:43,050
...I started to take pictures.

452
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,554
Hoping the pictures would make sense
of what I was seeing.

453
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:51,975
What did you see?

454
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,021
Hannah was doing more
than chatting that night, wasn't she?

455
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:02,194
-What did you see?
-She wasn't just texting, okay?

456
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,780
She was sexting.

457
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,991
And, like, showing herself off...

458
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,285
to some guy.

459
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:11,953
After everything she went through,
I just...

460
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,165
didn't understand why she would do that,

461
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:19,044
why she would share
that special part of herself

462
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,130
with just... some guy.

463
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:25,675
Someone who didn't care about her,
who didn't know how special she was.

464
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:32,057
So isn't it true that Hannah
opened herself up for a reaction,

465
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,811
and therefore, is in many ways responsible
for what followed?

466
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,856
Isn't she actually responsible?

467
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,692
What about you, Tyler?

468
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,530
Are you in no way responsible
for the things that happen to you?

469
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,828
Hey, Clay.

470
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:59,042
-Hey, Zach.
-Were you at court this morning?

471
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,878
Yeah.
I couldn't take Tyler's lies, so I left.

472
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,717
So how is this gonna happen?
Is everything gonna come out?

473
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:09,386
How the fuck would I know?

474
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,848
Well, when do you testify?

475
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:15,767
I don't.

476
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,145
What?
Why would they call me and not call you?

477
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,605
I don't know and I don't care.

478
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,607
How can you not care?

479
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,029
I care about my girlfriend and I care
about my grades, and that's plenty.

480
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,660
When you're under oath,
they can ask you anything, right?

481
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,998
You stole a fucking note.

482
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,167
Not like you raped her.
What are you worried about?

483
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:43,253
What about the tapes?
What about the tape you made?

484
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,673
Why are you still hanging around
with Bryce? What does he have on you?

485
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:52,679
I'm not hanging out with Bryce, okay?
I just-- I have to play baseball with him.

486
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,391
And I was just hoping that this trial
wouldn't fuck up everybody's life.

487
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:01,605
Well, too late.

488
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,524
I mean, it's not like it goes both ways.

489
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:10,572
There are the people who get hurt,
and the people who do the hurting.

490
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,304
Mr. Walker.

491
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,599
I was wondering
if I might have a word with you.

492
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,894
Kind of in the middle of something,
Mr. Porter.

493
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,439
I'll wait.
Your hair looks good. Get to class.

494
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:50,612
What's up?

495
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,032
Jessica Davis is back today.

496
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,244
Wanna let you know I got my eye on you.

497
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,287
You and a dozen college scouts.

498
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,498
I don't know
what that's got to do with Jessica.

499
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,752
Listen, you little shit.

500
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,588
I know everything
that I need to know about you.

501
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,883
You go near the girl,
you look in her direction,

502
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,635
and I will fuck up your life.

503
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,929
I don't think
you can speak to me that way.

504
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:17,722
I didn't.

505
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,561
I was just checking in on you.

506
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,774
Thought you may be a little upset,
with the trial starting and everything.

507
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:31,319
-You've got more to lose than I do.
-Do I?

508
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,074
We'll find out.

509
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,500
The day so far, not great?

510
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,711
Why didn't you tell me they outlawed me?

511
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,632
-What? That never happened.
-I mean, talking about me.

512
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,010
Or talking about me trying to kill myself.

513
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,263
-Shit. Did they?
-Yeah.

514
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,684
I kind of stopped listening
to morning announcements.

515
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,812
And teachers. And people.

516
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,816
You had a question for me?

517
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,321
Yeah, um, so you know
that I left a suicide note?

518
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:16,156
Um...

519
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,827
-Yeah.
-Why didn't you tell me about it?

520
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,623
Well, I-I didn't...

521
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:28,168
I mean, I didn't think it
was the kind of thing that you talk about

522
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:31,463
with someone who's like,
recovering from it.

523
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,679
Look. What do you think that this meant?

524
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:40,764
You have it here?

525
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:43,558
Yeah, they can't suspend me
for talking about me.

526
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,519
"I could have stopped it."

527
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,900
What does that mean,
"I could have stopped it"? Stopped what?

528
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:54,778
I...

529
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,198
I don't know. I mean...

530
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,534
You probably thought
you could've stopped Hannah.

531
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,996
You felt guilty. We all did.

532
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,040
I don't think that's it.

533
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:10,168
There's something more.

534
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,757
No one likes the kind of attention
Hannah got.

535
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,426
Or I got.

536
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:22,472
Or that I'm gonna get
when I leave court today

537
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,600
and have to go back to that school
where no one looks out for us.

538
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:30,772
-The hell?
-I never laid a hand on you.

539
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,651
Never. I saw other guys fucking with you,
I told them to back off.

540
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,569
So why are you talking about me in court?

541
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,948
Jesus, how did you know that already?
Did Clay tell you?

542
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,741
Never mind, just tell me why you talked.

543
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,993
'Cause your little darkroom threat
didn't scare me.

544
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,204
What "darkroom threat"?

545
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,582
You can fuck with me all you want,
I don't care. You'll pay.

546
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,293
Mr. Walker?

547
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:08,685
Listen, if uh...
if Bryce hassles you again,

548
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,811
you come and tell me.

549
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,149
And I want you
in my new special skills class.

550
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,653
-No, thank you.
-It's not optional.

551
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,530
I spoke to your folks.
You can start tomorrow.

552
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:47,056
I mean, Hannah took sexy pictures,

553
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,933
but that doesn't make her guilty
of anything.

554
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:55,106
One picture never tells the whole story.

555
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,262
Clay.

556
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:29,808
Hey, Tony.

557
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,144
What the hell, man?
You told me this case was gonna settle.

558
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:38,191
- We thought it was.
- Well, they called me to testify.

559
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,362
I-I wouldn't worry about it.

560
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,948
The Bakers know you did what Hannah asked.

561
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:48,201
The Bakers didn't call me.
The school did. Why?

562
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,037
I don't know.

563
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,665
My mom said each side calls

564
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:56,334
whoever they think will help
tell their version of the story.

565
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,254
How am I a part of the school's story?

566
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:02,715
You didn't do anything wrong.

567
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,176
You don't know everything I did, Clay.

568
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,889
Hey, Tony.

569
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:11,724
What, um...

570
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:15,812
What do you know about Scott Reed?

571
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,438
Uh, the baseball player?

572
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:21,067
He plays baseball
and he's friends with Bryce.

573
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,111
That's what I know. Why?

574
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,114
Uh, probably nothing.

575
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,620
Okay.

576
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,540
So, we live
in an "affirmative consent" state.

577
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,750
That means you must have
an actual affirmative

578
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:41,546
from your sexual partner
in order to engage in intercourse.

579
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,633
Silence or lack of resistance
does not demonstrate consent.

580
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,053
Consent must be given in words
or in actions.

581
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,680
Does a scream count?

582
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,808
You want to be a comedian, Mr. Reed?

583
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:56,060
Or you wanna play ball this year?

584
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,521
'Cause I can arrange
that you take the season off.

585
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,276
I didn't think so.

586
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:06,905
Right.

587
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,490
So, affirmative consent.

588
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,171
Hey.

589
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:26,007
What?

590
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,718
It's good to see you, too.

591
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,220
Oh, I'm sorry. "Hi, Ryan. How are things?

592
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,889
Really? He is a bitch.

593
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,807
You should dump him. You deserve better."

594
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,351
That about cover it?

595
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,898
They called me to testify
at Hannah's trial.

596
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,149
Okay.

597
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,778
Me too, but we're not
supposed to talk about it.

598
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:55,495
Here.

599
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,081
Everything she wrote about that day.

600
00:40:58,665 --> 00:40:59,540
All of it.

601
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,172
I'm not gonna say anything...

602
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,425
that could hurt you. I promise.

603
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:13,763
Thank you.

604
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,894
Pictures keep secrets,
just like people do.

605
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,108
...four, five, six, seven, eight.

606
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,403
One, two, three, four, five, six...

607
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,154
-Jessica, hi!
-Hi! How are you?

608
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:32,407
-You look good.
-I am good. Thank you.

609
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,325
-Hi, I missed you.
-Oh, God, I missed you.

610
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,327
-Jess!
-Hey, Chlöe.

611
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,329
Jess, it's so good to have you back.

612
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:41,791
And just in time. We're starting
our routining for summer competitions.

613
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,420
-And I want you to be a flyer.
-Wait. Wait, what?

614
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:48,506
-I thought I was supposed--
-You have the athleticism and focus.

615
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,719
And hey, it's work,
but you're ready, right?

616
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:55,096
Totally. I'm totally ready.

617
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,099
All right.
Well, let's start marking it out.

618
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,060
Jess, this one's new,
so maybe watch first time around.

619
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,186
Okay, cool.

620
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,832
All right, Walker, all right.
Let's try that slider again.

621
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,299
That's right, guys, get it together.
Let's talk it through.

622
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,595
Five, six, seven...
One, two, three, four...

623
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,890
- You all right, man?
- Yeah, of course. Why?

624
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,976
Well, that's three I had to chase.
I already did wind sprints today.

625
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,146
Yeah, the breaking shit isn't breaking.

626
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,816
One, two, three, lift,
five, six, seven, eight.

627
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,319
-One, two, three...
-Hey, it's all right. You got this.

628
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:53,654
Maybe you can throw something
he can hit?

629
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,114
I'm just picking grass out here.

630
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:58,201
I'm not gonna make the obvious joke
about Mexicans picking shit.

631
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,370
All right, let's go, Walker.
The infields are trying to be funny,

632
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,207
-and that never works.
-Oh, you love us, Dempsey.

633
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,543
Last batter, Walker.

634
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,961
Then you gotta ice that arm.

635
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,632
...set, one, lift, three,
up, five, six, seven...

636
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,717
So, you're sure
your dad's not gonna come up?

637
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:17,345
-Yeah, he visits as little as possible.
-Okay.

638
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,471
Anyway, he likes you.

639
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,308
Yeah, we bonded
those first few weeks I visited you.

640
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,852
-What'd you bring?
-Okay, so...

641
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:27,730
Cool Ranch Doritos.

642
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,777
-Sour Patch Kids.
-Yes. Fucking amazing.

643
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,656
So this is really, like, illegal?

644
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,574
Yeah, my mom has me on all like,

645
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,828
organic whole-grain macrobiotic shit.

646
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,171
So good. You want?

647
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,674
Uh, yeah, but I should probably
wash my hands first.

648
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:28,791
That's where it went.

649
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,504
The bullet. That's where it went.

650
00:44:34,964 --> 00:44:38,176
Yeah, I had never shot
that kind of gun before,

651
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:42,054
so it was heavier than the other ones,
and I flinched.

652
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:47,101
And the bullet went up, and then
in and out of my skull and into the wall.

653
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:48,519
That's what they told me.

654
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,814
You don't remember?

655
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:56,694
No, I don't remember anything
of like, a month before that.

656
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,072
So, the tapes?

657
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,117
I know about them.

658
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,328
And I know we all did shit, but...

659
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:07,705
I don't remember listening to them.

660
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,666
I took pictures of you...

661
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,044
while you were in your coma.

662
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,379
Why?

663
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:17,798
Because I knew you were gonna get better.

664
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:23,512
So I wanted to like, document...
how far you had to go.

665
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,015
I'm sorry, I...

666
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,100
I-I don't care.

667
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,605
Could I see them?

668
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:35,733
Sometime?

669
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:38,861
Uh...

670
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:41,197
Yeah.

671
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,450
Concession stand is almost done.

672
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,787
We're gonna be putting finishing touches
on the outfield fence.

673
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:50,623
The new scoreboard's going up there,
we're gonna re-line the fields,

674
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,042
and get all the details done
before Thursday.

675
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,085
All right.

676
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,419
How about the naming?

677
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,713
Oh, well, it goes on top
of the scoreboard,

678
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,007
both dugouts and the concession stand.

679
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:03,803
-But all the plaques are up.
-And we don't think this trial...

680
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:07,598
we don't think this trial
will be a distraction, do we?

681
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:10,351
No, no, no. No, no, no.
We have everything very well contained.

682
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,020
-We're protecting our students.
-Good. Good.

683
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,438
How's the team?

684
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:20,319
Oh. Uh, well, despite the tragic loss
of Jeff Atkins,

685
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:25,199
I'm told we still have the best team
in years. Since your time, even.

686
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,327
Hey, Dad.

687
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,455
How's the arm?

688
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,207
One hundred percent.

689
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,750
Okay.

690
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:38,546
See you later. Bye.

691
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,632
- Hey, Bethany,
- Right there.

692
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:43,175
That dude got demolished.

693
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,386
-Oh, hey.
-Ow.

694
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:48,097
Hey, Jess. Jessica.

695
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,517
-Hey, Jess, wait up.
-Hey.

696
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,437
-Hey. Welcome back.
-Thank you.

697
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:57,314
So, how you doing? Okay?

698
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,526
-Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good.
-Good. Good.

699
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:04,405
I mean, it's good to have you back.
We missed you. The squad did, for sure.

700
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,324
-Yeah, well, I'm back.
-Cool.

701
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,661
Hey, let's grab a drink sometime.
Catch up.

702
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:14,665
-Let's grab a drink?
-Yeah.

703
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,962
Whatever. I'm late for dinner.

704
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:21,422
Okay.

705
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:26,135
-Hey, baby.
-Hi.

706
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,567
Thanks for having me over.

707
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:45,237
I'm happy to have the company.

708
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,656
The DoubleTree does free wine
in the evenings,

709
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,452
but it's all software salespeople
and Rotarians, and...

710
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,873
-I'm just glad you're not sick of me yet.
-No, never.

711
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,626
Today was a good day, Olivia.

712
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,795
Tyler was believable,

713
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:04,173
and the jury will remember the bullying
more than anything else.

714
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,383
What are you working on?

715
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:08,010
Oh, um...

716
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:12,598
-I asked Dennis to send over...
-Oh.

717
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:14,725
...some of the discovery
that came up today.

718
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,020
I always thought these pictures
were so beautiful.

719
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,939
Ooh, that's a good one.

720
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,234
That's not your best angle.

721
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:24,860
That's good.

722
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,530
No, too much chin.

723
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,491
Don't worry.
I'm deleting all of them.

724
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,244
I'm never taking another picture again
in my life.

725
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:34,328
Why?

726
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,833
A picture can be twisted,
used against you, and haunt you forever.

727
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,585
My dear Hannah. Such drama.

728
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,969
Why didn't I just tell her she was pretty?

729
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,889
Why didn't I just say she was perfect?

730
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:56,350
Oh, Olivia. You did.

731
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,435
I know you did, thousands of times.

732
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,728
I don't know if I did.

733
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,273
Or I didn't enough, or...

734
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,525
or not in the right way.

735
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:07,903
Every morning, I would tell Tessa

736
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:10,114
she was the most beautiful girl
in the world.

737
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,410
Then she would go to that school
where kids called her "ugly,"

738
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,163
called her "worthless,"

739
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,914
called her "slut."

740
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,209
And she believed them, and not me.

741
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,421
This is what it's gonna be like, isn't it?

742
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:29,258
They're going to paint this picture
of some girl I don't even recognize.

743
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,176
Yes.

744
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:32,470
But you're going to have to stay strong.

745
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,763
You know who Hannah was.

746
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:36,765
What if I don't?

747
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,852
I didn't know who took these pictures.

748
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,980
I didn't know she had a stalker.
What else don't I know?

749
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,899
You know how special she was.

750
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,944
And how that school
let her be taken away from you.

751
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:57,536
You have these pictures of Hannah.

752
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:02,166
And you say they mean one thing,
but you don't know.

753
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,421
Just because you have the picture
doesn't mean you have the truth.

754
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:14,845
Why'd you lie about Hannah?

755
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:17,556
I didn't lie.

756
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,516
Why would she be sexting,
after what happened?

757
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,435
I don't know, but it was the truth.

758
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,437
Then who was it with?

759
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,522
-I'm not afraid of you.
-What's that mean?

760
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:28,234
-The darkroom last night? Come on.
-What about the darkroom?

761
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,903
-Someone's trying to keep me quiet.
-Yeah, well, it wasn't me.

762
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,571
Then I bet they'll come after you, too.

763
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,908
I don't fucking care.
Who was she texting with?

764
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,534
I don't know.

765
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,496
Fuck this.

766
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:42,998
I know you thought she was perfect,
but she wasn't.

767
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,085
I bet I'm not the only one who knows that.

768
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:03,519
I like the color.

769
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:08,983
Wal-Plex locked up
their spray paint again,

770
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,777
so I had to jack it from the True Value.

771
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:16,365
I love how the Wal-Plex locks up
spray paint but not their ammunition.

772
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:24,748
Hey, can we, uh...?

773
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,544
Can we try this thing again?

774
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:31,714
Yeah. Let's do this thing.

775
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:48,689
Jesus!

776
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:49,982
Clay!

777
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:54,987
Uh... Sorry, I just, uh--
Sorry, I don't know what happened.

778
00:51:58,824 --> 00:51:59,700
Okay.

779
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,577
What...?

780
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,912
Oh, my God, you're shaking. What's wrong?

781
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:07,750
Nothing, I'm... I'm fine.

782
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,877
Okay. Clay.

783
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:14,673
This is gonna be okay, you know?
You're gonna be great.

784
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:19,011
Yeah, no, I know.
I mean, I don't know. I mean, that's not--

785
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,679
Okay, shut up and get naked.

786
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:36,403
What the fuck?

787
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,742
What is wrong with you tonight, Clay?

788
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:43,869
I can't.

789
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:48,957
-You said you loved me.
-No, I--

790
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,752
Look, I do. God, I do.

791
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,171
You don't want to touch me,
to be with me.

792
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:56,173
No, I do, I just...

793
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,052
I can't tonight.

794
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,056
Okay.

795
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:07,935
I'll see you tomorrow, then.

796
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,405
Unless you were there,
you don't know what really happened.

797
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:13,000
We'll ask the court
for a medical exception.

798
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,627
I hear that Standall kid
might not have to testify.

799
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,045
-Dad.
-Honey...

800
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,715
your mother and I don't like this.

801
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,302
We read about what happened to Tyler.
They can ask anything up there.

802
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,761
But I have to do it.

803
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:26,889
For Hannah.

804
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,269
Okay, let's talk about it in the morning.

805
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:34,396
Get some sleep.

806
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,921
Just because you have the picture
doesn't mean you have the whole story.

807
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,433
What are you gonna do about that?

808
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:08,782
So you talk now?

809
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:11,201
Apparently.

810
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:17,749
Oh.

Well done, Ed. Well done.
